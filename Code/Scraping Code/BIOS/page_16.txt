Rouzbeh BehniaAssistant Professorbehnia@usf.eduCampus: Sarasota-ManateeRoom: C266Phone: 941-359-4605VitaPersonal WebsiteRouzbeh is an assistant professor in the School of Information Systems and Management
               (SISM) at USF.His research spans the areas of cybersecurity, blockchain, and applied cryptography.
               He has worked on developing highly efficient authentication schemes for low-end embedded
               IoT devices. His research has also focused on solutions to address the data privacy
               versus utilization dilemma. In the realm of post-quantum security, he has developed
               several efficient cryptographic schemes with post-quantum security. His work has resulted
               in a number of patents and has been published in top CS venues such as ACM CCS, IEEE
               TDSC, ACM AsiaCCS, ACSAC, etc.Rouzbeh has earned a PhD in Computer Science from the University of South Florida

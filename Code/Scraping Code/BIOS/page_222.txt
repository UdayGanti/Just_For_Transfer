               College of Engineering. His current research involves teacher and K-16 cybersecurity
               and engineering (STEM) education/outreach, AI/ML applications, Windows malware detection,
               modeling and simulation, detective/predictive/preventive analytics, and forensic analysis
               of cybersecurity attacks/threats. He is a senior member of IEEE and ASEE and a Fellow
               of IEEE WTS.His main research area has been applications of communication, signal processing and
               data analysis in different fields of physical science and engineering such as GIS/remote
               sensing, biomedicine, oceanography, satellite communications, embedded systems, radar
               imaging, systems health and predictive analytics just to name a few. He has a long
               list of publications, awards, and research grants including more than $6 mllion in
               funded projects from NASA, NSF, NIH, DoD, DEd, CyberFlorida and industry partners
               such as Google, Microsoft and Texas Instruments. He has had more than six years of
               experience working for the wireless communication industries (BellSouth and Siemens
               Telecom) and has been awarded seven summer faculty research fellowships with NASA
               (GSFC, AMES, SSC) and ONR. He has had countless contributions to his field through
               these fellowships including design and development of innovative space RF communication
               systems and instruments, remote sensing from space- and air-borne sensors, satellite/radar
               image processing and blind quality assessment, spacecraft power system health management,
               and many undergraduate and graduate publications among others.Sheybani earned a PhD from USF, a master's degree from Florida State University and
               a bachelor's degree from the University of Florida, all with concentrations on electrical
               engineering.

Movies on the Lawn
The tradition of Movies on the Lawn (MOTL) began in Fall 1991 when a student named
               Stacy Bruels suggested that the back wall of the Special Events Center be used to
               screen newly released films. Until 2009, a movie was shown every Wednesday at 9pm
               with popcorn, cotton candy, snow cones, nachos, a variety of candy and other treats
               given out to students.
Today, recently released movies are projected onto the Bookstore wall and played biweekly. 
All movies are shown on the MSC Bookstore lawn or Oval Theater at 9 p.m. In the event
               of inclement weather, an alternate location will be announced the day of the movie.

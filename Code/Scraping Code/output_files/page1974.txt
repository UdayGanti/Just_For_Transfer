Faculty Authored Textbook Guidelines
Guidelines for Use of Faculty Authored Textbooks or Other Course Materials
In compliance with Florida Statute 112.131, faculty members who are the author of
               a textbook, book, software, or collateral materials and who requires the use of that
               material in their course or courses, must receive approval prior to that use. The
               faculty member must certify that the required materials are uniquely suited for use
               in the course. A form is provided here by which approval can be requested.
The above reporting requirements also apply when the faculty member assigning the
               materials is a relative of the author, a member of a teaching team of which the author
               is a member, or if the author is in a position to require the materials in any University
               course or program.
This policy is not intended to prevent faculty from using materials they have produced
               in their courses, but to ensure the materials are being used to the benefit of USF
               students. The Department/School Chair/Director should review the request carefully
               and make a recommendation to the Dean, who makes a recommendation to the Office of
               the Provost.  
Requests from the faculty should include the following information for consideration
               by the Chair/Director, Dean, and Provost:

Semester(s) that the faculty-authored materials will be used
Name of the textbook, book, software or collateral materials
Course number and section(s)
Estimated enrollment per year
Potential royalty based on estimated enrollment
Justification for requiring the faculty-authored materials in the course

It is the responsibility of the faculty member to obtain approval prior to submitting
               the book order to the Campus Bookstore.

Continuity of Operations Planning 
To ensure the fundamental mission of the University is protected at all times, USF
               Emergency Management supports Continuity of Operations (COOP) Planning .
What is COOP?
COOP planning is designed to identify essential functions and plan for the continuation
               of these functions during a disaster or emergency. A Continuity of Operations Plan
               establishes priorities and procedures to ensure delivery of essential operations of
               the University and provide for alternate methods and locations of operations for an
               extended event. COOP planning is required by Florida Statutes Section 252.365.

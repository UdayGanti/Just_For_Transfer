                  				General Requirements
                  			
The Muma College of Business has many upper-level programs, which means that they
                  have specific admission requirements in addition to those of USF in general. Students
                  interested in pursuing a degree offered by the Muma College of Business must complete
                  the required prerequisites for progression.

                  				Transfer Requirements
                  			
In addition to general admission requirements, transfer credits will be accepted from
                  accredited institutions; however, all hours earned may not be applied toward USF business
                  degree requirements. Individual courses will be evaluated by an academic advisor and
                  appropriately credited toward requirements in the student’s program at USF.

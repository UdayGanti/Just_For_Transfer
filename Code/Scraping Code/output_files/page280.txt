The USF Muma College of Business 25 Under 25 program recognizes both undergraduate
               and graduate students from all USF campuses who have demonstrated success in at least
               two of the following four categories: academics, leadership, professional development,
               and campus/community service.  To be selected for this program, students submit an
               essay, résumé, and, in some cases, reference letters or other documentation to verify
               that they have served their community well.

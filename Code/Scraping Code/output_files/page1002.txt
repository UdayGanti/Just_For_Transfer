USF Campus Safety Day
2022 Event
In light of the impacts from Hurricane Ian and the extended response efforts from
               many of the our on and off campus partners who participate in Campus Safety Day, the
               decision has been made to cancel the event on October 6, 2022. Discussions are still
               in place for rescheduling the event for a future date this academic year.

Per federal law, Title IX at USF is obliged to provide the materials used at its various
               Title IX trainings. These materials can be found on the appropriate menus within this
               section of the website.


                  				Employee Training

                  even one USF student or employee in any capacity (including Adjunct, Teaching Assistants,

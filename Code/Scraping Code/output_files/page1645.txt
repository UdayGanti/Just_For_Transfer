At the USF Muma College of Business, the business world is part of the classroom and
               USF's undergraduate curriculum provides rich opportunities to bridge theory and practice,
               just as the metropolitan location provides opportunities for student internships,
               part-time jobs, and cooperative education experiences relevant to students' career
               goals.
Two aids in bridging theory and practice are embedded into the curriculum – the Business
               & Workplace Skills and Best Practices Certificate with Sandler Inc providing students
               with the workplace skills to launch their careers, and the Citizen Data Science Certificate
               training students in Tableau data visualization.
Bachelor of Arts/Science
The two undergraduate degrees offered, the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Science,
               are broad enough in nature to give students an understanding of the arts, humanities,
               and sciences, while narrow enough to provide a thorough understanding of business
               and management tenets. Students may major in one of the following areas: accounting,
               business advertising, finance, personal finance, management, marketing, business analytics
               and information systems, hospitality management, information assurance and cybersecurity
               management, entrepreneurship, supply chain management, risk management and insurance,
               or global business.

Career Development & Coaching
Students are supported in their professional development through one-on-one coaching
               with experienced career professionals.  The coaching supplements and reinforces the
               skills and concepts introduced in the program with individualized support, while also
               addressing student-specific interests and objectives.
All students within the Bellini Certification Program levels 3 and 4 will meet with a career coach. Our coaches will use their knowledge,
               experience, and commitment to equip students with the ability to develop and achieve
               their career and professional development goals. We aim to ensure every graduate of
               the Muma College of Business has the opportunity to successfully compete for the job
               and career they want within three months of graduation.

St. Petersburg Campus

On July 1, 2020, the Kate Tiedemann College of Business entered a new era as the Kate
               Tiedemann School of Business and Finance under the Muma College of Business. The school is located in Lynn
               Pippenger Hall on USF’s St. Petersburg waterfront campus, on the edge of downtown
               in the St. Pete Innovation District. Built in 2017, Lynn Pippenger Hall is a LEED
               Gold Certified four-story building with more than 68,000 square feet of light-filled classroom,
               office, and open, collaborative meeting spaces. Its unique features include the (three-story) Ellen
               Cotton Atrium, a 200-seat auditorium, the Customer Experience Lab, the Bishop Center
               for Ethical Leadership, and the Merrill Lynch Wealth Management Center.
Small classes, high-quality experiential learning, and community engagement are hallmarks
               of the student experience. The continuous enrichment of students is made possible
               with support from the community at large, local business partners, advisory board
               members, and dedicated alumni. We are especially grateful to the school’s three women
               benefactors, Kate Tiedemann, Ellen Cotton, and Lynn Pippenger for their continued
               support.

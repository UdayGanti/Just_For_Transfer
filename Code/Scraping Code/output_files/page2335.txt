Program Rules:
In the case that a team member(s) is under performing, the other members may present
                        this information to the board of judges and request to have said member fired. If
                        the board of judges agrees, the said member will be fired and disqualified from the
                        competition. In this situation, the team can choose to recruit a new member, with
                        the board’s approval. Throughout the course of the competition, teams may not disclose
                        any financials with outside members (i.e. the opposing team) until the winner has
                        been announced.

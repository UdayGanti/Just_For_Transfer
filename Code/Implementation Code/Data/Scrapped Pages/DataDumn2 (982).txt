Overview
Academic continuity refers to the continuation of instructional delivery at the University
               of South Florida through our learning management tool Canvas and providing students
               with continuing remote access to support services. 
USF is committed to providing our students with quality academics and essential services
               both in-person and virtually to support success in achieving their academic goals.
               The toolkits provided for students, families, and faculty will help guide our community
               members with current information and links to helpful resources for all campuses.

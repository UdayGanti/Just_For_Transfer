Exercises
A fundamental element of preparedness is to conduct exercises or drills in order to
               practice and evaluate our level of readiness. Exercises come in many different forms
               and sizes, ranging from a small workshop to a full-scale live-action response.
USF hosted exercises follow the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program
                  (HSEEP) guidelines.
The Department of Emergency Management participates in several types of exercises
               and drills, both within the University and alongside our community response partners.
Interested in participating in a tabletop exercise?
If your USF affiliated office or organization would like to schedule your own short
               tabletop exercise or drill, contact Emergency Management at USF-EmergencyMgmt@usf.edu for more information.

Classroom Door Locks

Facilities Management is installing push button emergency door lock systems to enable
               occupants to quickly and easily lock down the room during emergency situations. When
               activated, room occupants will be able to exit the space, but the doors will be locked
               from the outside.
In 2017 emergency door lock buttons were installed in the 20 largest classrooms on
               campus, Facilities Management will continue installing the systems in classroom across
               campus as part of a multi-phase plan.

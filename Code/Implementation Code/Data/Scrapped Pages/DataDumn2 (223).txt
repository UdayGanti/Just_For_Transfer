Internships
Having an internship increases the chances of having a job at graduation. USF Muma
                  College of Business leadership, faculty, and staff share more about the importance
                  of internships in this video.

Everyone wins with internship programs. Employers are able to boost workplace productivity
               and students are able to strengthen business skills. Students gain real-life experiences,
               learn new programs, and experience life in a professional workplace. Employers gain
               temporary help from fresh and eager aspiring business leaders. While internships are
               not deliberately designed to serve as extended interviews, they often allow employers
               to evaluate potential new hires before extending an offer.

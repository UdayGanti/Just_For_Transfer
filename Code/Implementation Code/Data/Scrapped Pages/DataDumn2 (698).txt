Muma College of Business Honor Pledge
I understand that being a part of the USF Muma College of Business community is not
               a right but a privilege, and to remain a part of this community I pledge the following:

I will never give nor receive unauthorized aid on any exams, assignments, or work
                  of any kind.
I will respect the property and personal rights of all members of the Muma College
                  of Business Community.
I will truthfully represent fact and self at all times.
I will personally support and promote the student Honor Pledge among my peers.

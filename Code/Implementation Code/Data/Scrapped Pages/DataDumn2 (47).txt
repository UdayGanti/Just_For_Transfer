Overview

Available on this section of the website is various information and resources for
               employees and managers/supervisors for employee separations.
If you are an employee resigning from your position or plan to resign, you should
               indicate as such in writing to your supervisor, giving your expected last day of work.
               Two weeksâ€™ notice is a standard expectation for resignation, but is not a requirement.
               The Information for Employees page provides information and resources specific to
               employees who are separating from employment with the university.
For managers/supervisors of employees who are separating employment, the Information
               for Managers/Supervisors page provides information and resources that may be beneficial
               to reference leading up to the separation date. If there are additional questions
               and/or concerns, please refer to the Employee Relations page for more information or to contact an Employee Relations Partner.

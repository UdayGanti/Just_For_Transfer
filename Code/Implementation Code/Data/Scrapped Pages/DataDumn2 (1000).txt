Overview
There are a number of resources at the university level for faculty support, ranging
               from the Digital Learning Live Support team (where experts respond live to questions related to Canvas, MS Teams or any digital
               learning solution) to toolkits created by the Academic Continuity unit. At the college level, the Muma College of Business Teaching Academy puts together workshops and seminars to help faculty stay current on teaching trends
               and support a culture of teaching and collaboration across the six schools that comprise
               the Muma College of Business.
Similarly, USF Research and Innovation has numerous university-wide resources for inventors, researchers, and research administrators including tools, forms, policies,
               and reports.  At the college level, the Muma College of Business has a unit research
               administrator who helps faculty find opportunities for funded research, the preparation
               and submission of competitive proposals and the management of awarded grants.

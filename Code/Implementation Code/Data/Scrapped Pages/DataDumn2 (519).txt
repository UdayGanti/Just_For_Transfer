Chat with a Muma Ambassador
Prospective students are encouraged to connect with a Muma College of Business Ambassador.
               Below you will find profiles for both student and staff ambassadors ready to chat
               with you about the experience of being a graduate student in the Muma College of Business.
Before you chat:

Review profiles of either students or staff and select an ambassador you would like
                  to chat with
Select "Create Your Account"
Complete your quick profile
Adjust your “Notification Preferences” under “Settings” to receive replies via email,
                  SMS or What's App

Response Time: When chatting with a student, most messages will receive a quick response, but some
               may take up to 24 hours. Feel free to ask them any questions about their program,
               what it's like to be a Muma College of Business graduate student, how they manage
               their busy schedules, etc. Staff members reply to questions during working hours Monday-Friday
               from 9-5pm Eastern Time with a 24 hour response time in most instances. A staff member
               is the best point of contact for admissions related questions, application and enrollment
               steps, and curriculum matters.

Overview



“Bank of America and USF St. Petersburg share a mission of supporting the development
                     of young people in the business world. This new initiative will allow students to
                     take control of their personal finances – and good financial planning equals a bright
                     future.”– Bill Goede, Tampa Bay president, Bank of America.

 


The Merrill Lynch Wealth Management Center, within the Muma College of Business, serves
               both university stakeholders and the greater community.
Students have the option of pursuing a Certified Financial Analyst track or Certified
               Financial Planning track. The state-of the-art venue allows students to analyze stocks,
               assess investment opportunities and apply skills learned in class to manage wealth.
Financial literacy initiatives are partially sponsored by a $500,000 grant from the
               Bank of America Charitable Foundation. Efforts include the development of a finance
               academy for high school students, programs on budget management for college students
               and social security and retirement workshops.

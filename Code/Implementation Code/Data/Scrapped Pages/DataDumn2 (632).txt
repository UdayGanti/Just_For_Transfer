Overview
The M3 Center for Hospitality Technology and Innovation was established at University
               of South Florida in 2013. The M3 Center was made possible by a transformational gift
               from Tampa businessman John McKibbon.
The mission of the M3 Center is to enable and conduct rigorous academic research of
               significance to the global hospitality industry, while serving as a critical reporting
               outlet and resource for educational tools and innovation, conferences, training and
               forums for improving the connections between academia, industry and the society at
               large. The M3 Center conducts cutting-edge research that advances the global hospitality
               industry and allows USF to share with other universities and hospitality students
               groundbreaking educational technologies and learning tools in hotel accounting, property
               management systems and business intelligence software. Working with an industry partner
               that is a leader in both hospitality management and information technology enables
               USF to create synergies that will benefit hospitality education as well as the entire
               industry. To visit M3 Center's website, visit http://m3center.org/. To contact M3 Center, visit https://www.m3center.org/contact.

Severe Weather Contingency Planning

Severe weather may present hazards and risks that must be considered during the planning
               phase of an outdoor event. To prepare, event organizers must consider potential weather
               conditions and the plan of action that will be taken during such occurrences. Severe
               weather may include thunderstorms, lightning, and/or tornados. During the event, event
               organizers must monitor weather conditions.
The National Weather Service may issue severe weather watches or warnings.

A watch means that conditions are favorable for development, and you should be aware
                  and monitor weather information.
A warning means that activity has been sighted or detected by radar and you should
                  take protective actions immediately

Information on current warnings and current weather in the area may be found at www.weather.gov.
We encourage event organizers to register to receive AlertUSF text notifications to stay informed of emergency situations impacting the campus. AlertUSF
               will be used to alert the USF community when a Tornado Warning impacting a USF campus
               has been issued. 
Use the Severe Weather Contingency Plan Template to develop a plan for any outdoor event.

NOTE  1: Over the years, the meaning o f grade s has become distorted by gra de inflation (the 
tendency of some teachers to give artificially high grades).  This has led many students to 
consider anything less than an “A” as unsatisfactory.  Howev er, in this class, a “B” represents a 
good grade a nd “As”  are reserved for truly extra ordinary accomplishments.  
 
NOTE  2: To facilitate the course objectives, the schedule on the next  two page s may be adjus ted 
throughout the semester.

NOTES ON COURSE REQU IREMENTS  
 
• The pu rpose of the quizzes is to en courage students to study the book  and class material .  
Approximately o ne half of each qui z will be over the two or three relevant chapter s assigned 
for the we ek and the other half will cov er topics discussed in the corresponding class es. Each 
quiz will include approximately 10 multiple choice questions and one or two short -answer 
questions. Quizzes will be given during the fir st 30 minutes of class.   
 
• The research pre sentation will i nvolve your team summarizing and discussing a r ecent (20 18-
2023) article.  In addition to exp laining the article, a maj or objective is to integrate the ideas 
and findings from the article with other  class materia l. The presentation will be 45-60 
minutes lo ng and may include slides, ha ndouts, discussion , Q&A, and any other activities the 
team finds  pertinent to thoroughly c ommunicating the key points of the article and linking 
them to other class mate rial.  The sam ple feedback form on the nex t page identifie s the 
criteria on which you w ill be assessed.  You may choose an article from any of the foll owing : 
 
Scientific Journal s    Practitioner Journals   
 
Journal of Applied Psychology  Harvard Business Rev iew  
Academy o f Management  Journal   Academ y of Management Perspectives  
Personnel Psycho logy   California Management Review  
Journal of Management   Sloan  Management Review  
 
• Partic ipation includes completing a number of in -class and out -of-class assignments , peer 
assessmen t, and being involved in cla ss discussions.  The assignments will be expl ained in 
class.  P eer ratings will reflect the quality of partic ipation in the research pr esentation and 
other team activities.  The below scale will give you an idea ab out how I will  approach the 
task of gradin g involvement in  class discussions:  
 
A. Visible,  thoughtful, and r egular involvement in class discussion.  You g ot involved, 
and not just for the purpose of hearing yourself speak.  Class members seemed to pay 
attenti on to what you  said, and your comments alm ost always were appropriate to the 
context.  
 
B. Tending toward the  quieter side, but active and alert enough in large and small group 
discussions that it was clear you were engaged in what was going on.  Comments, 
though offered le ss often than by an “A,” alm ost always were appropriate to the 
context.  
 
C. Dutifully present for class, but usually without indications of active participation.  I 
couldn’t always tell if you were following what was going on in class, or your 
comme nts were o ften off the mark.  
 
D/F    L ike a C, but wit h substantial unexplained abs ences that kept yo u from participating.

8. Unive rsity Emergency Policy  
 
In the event of an emergency, i t may be necess ary for USF to suspend normal operations. 
During this time , USF may opt to continue delivery of ins truction through methods that  
include bu t are not limited to: Canvas, MS Teams, Ellumin ate, Skype, and email messa ging 
and/or an alternate sch edule. It's the  responsibility of the student to monitor C anvas site for 
each class for co urse specific communication, and t he main USF, Colleg e, and depa rtmen t 
websites, emails, and MoBull messages fo r important general informa tion. 
 
9. Campus Free Expression:  It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to 
support an environmen t where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openl y 
exchanged and critica lly evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve 
discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
  
In the instr uctional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objec tive manner and not 
as an endorsemen t of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) 
presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is  8 
supported by credible research . Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or 
criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In 
this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex i deas and to demonstrate an 
understanding of  the ideas. Understan ding an idea does not mean that you are required to 
believe it or agree with it.  
  
10. Title IX Policy : Title IX provides federal protections for discrimination based on sex, which 
includes discri mination based on pregnancy, sexual harassm ent, and interpersona l violence. 
In an effort to provide support and equal access,  USF has designated all faculty (TA, 
Adjunct, etc.) as Responsible Employees, who are required to report any disclosures of 
sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship v iolence or stalking.  The Title IX Office 
makes every effort, when safe to do so, to reach out and provide resources and 
accommodations, and to discuss possible options for resolution.   Anyone wishing to make a 
Title IX report or seeking accommodations may do so online, in pers on, via phone, or email 
to the Title IX Office. For information about Title IX or for a full list of resources please 
visit:  https://www.usf.edu/title -ix/gethelp/resources.aspx . If you are unsure what to do, 
please contact Victim Advocacy – a confidential resource that can review all your options – 
at 813 -974-5756 or  va@admin.u sf.edu .

I. Course Description :   
Welcome to ISM 4547!  This project -based  course provides students with an opportunity to explore business analytics using 
advanced Exc el techniques, incorporating data modeling .   Prerequisites: CGS2100 and ISM3011  
II. Course Objectives  
Using projects  and discussions this course is intended to emphasize  the role of business analysts and data scientists in 
organizations and how creative use of strong technical ski lls can lead to  career advancement in any field .  Students should be 
comfortable using Exce l coming into the class to get the most out of the course activities.   
III. Learning Outcomes .  Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:

IV. Course Structure & Format:  
This is a  hybrid,  flipped, project -based course, meaning that we’ll do preparation and skills practice online / at home most 
Tuesdays to introduce new skills .  I’ll have in -class sessions on Thursdays for face -to-face help.   I try to provide all the tools 
and resources needed for this class, but you are ultimately responsible for taking advantage  of these resources for a 
successful learning experience.       
• Tuesdays  (online , after the first week )– I’ll provide video demos to in troduce or reinforce new skills and there will be an 
‘Exploration Exercise’ (EE) assigned.  
• Thursday  (face -to-face) will be  a workday .  I’ll be in the class to answer any questions you may have . 
• Sunday  is the due date for the EEs . LinkedIn activities and module projects .   
V. Covid -19 Procedures  
All students must comply with university policies and posted signs regarding COVID -19 mitigation measures .  Details are

IX. Course Policies :  
• Assignments :  
o Exploration Exercises (EEs) are introduced on Tuesdays , either in -pers on or online.  H elp is available on Thursdays 
and the EEs are due by the following  Sunday , submitted via Canvas . 
o Module projects are also submitted to Canvas, due on Sundays, the due dates are listed above .  
 • Canvas : Announcements,  assignments, online materials, and grades are all on Canvas.  Check it frequently (it is your 
friend).  Be sure that you have set up Canvas to forward email and announcements to the email account you most use. If 
you are new to Canvas, there are free clas ses available through academic computing or stop by  during office hours with 
questions.  
• Email :  Please send email to bwarner@usf.edu  or via Canvas email.  
• Re-grade Policy : Re-grade requests  should be emailed to me within two weeks from the date your grade was posted and 
before the end of the semester.  To do this, download and review a copy of your sub mitted project from Canvas and then 
email me with a description of what was graded incorrectly and why it’s incorrect.  I will do a re -grade but will re -grade 
the whole project and any grading mistakes or omissions (positive or negative) will be corrected.    
• Due dates / late dates : Projects are submitted via Canvas and should be submitted by the due date , Eastern Standard 
Time.  Please don’t wait until the last hour to submit, as often that leads to late submissions .  Work can be submitted late 
with a penalty of 5% per day .  Late work will automatically receive a zero grade in Canvas until the work has been 
reviewed and graded.  
• Illness :  If you are excused from work/school for a period of time, please contact me as soon as possible so I will know 
about your situation.  A note from a local doctor or clinic will be required for late submissions.  The note should include 
dates excused from work and school.  If you think you have Covid,  please get a Covid test from the University  ( schedule 
online, no cost ) and send the results to me and we can go from there.  Usually there is a 5 -day ex tension on any work due 
during that time.  
• Project Support : I am available for project help during Thursday class time  and scheduled office hours . Be sure to give 
yourself enough time so you can receive assistance when needed.  While I’m also  available for help via email, email 
support is limited  as it’s often  harder to adequately respond to  project  questions via email .  Weekend email responses 
are not guaranteed.  Start early, submit  early.  
• Submitting  Projects:  
o No email s ubmissions .  All work  must be submitted via Canvas.  
o Procrastination : Please don’t wait until the l ast minute to submit projects and note that C anvas is the official time 
clock  (work due by 11:59:00 EST) .  If you submit close to the deadline and your project takes a few extra minutes to 
upload it will be considered late.  Start early, submit early.  
o Check  your Uploads – Required : Once you submit a project to C anvas, look at the submission information on the 
right side of your screen and 1) download a copy of your project file(s) FROM Canvas to another folder on your 
computer.  2) Open these files, be sure they’re complete, the right project, etc.  and then 3) save this copy.  This is 
your back up copy and the creation and last modified dates will be retained as  long you do n’t open them  again.  
o Oops !  Work submitted to Canvas incorrectly that cannot be opened or graded for any reason is considered late and 
may or may not be accepted later.  Check your uploads to avoid this.  
• ‘Technology  problems’ , including bad files, bad file  names, not knowing how to upload to Canvas correctly (not checking 
an upload), locked files, lost work, slow or bad Internet connection,  power losses,  etc. are not valid excuses for 
late/missing work – they are just part of using computers .  Ask questio ns, get help, do your work early and check that 
assignments are submitted correctly so the inevitable computer problems will not lead to missed points.   
• Extra  Credit  / Curves / Grades.  Extra credit may be available during the semester.  Any extra points will help if you are 
‘close’ to the next grade level and usually the place of any curve or any ‘rounding’ in the class.  Activities will be described 
in on Canvas.  Any integrity violations involving extra c redit will result in the loss of all extra credit points.   **Most 
students do very well in this class, however if this is one of your last classes needed to graduate or to keep a scholarship,  
be sure to monitor your grades .  
• Course Courtesy.  Please see o ur Canvas Modules area on expectations for students and instructors, but basically – 
please treat all with kindness and patience, respecting and tolerating different opinions  as well technological abilitie s.  
 
X. Academic  Integrity - Integrity does matter  
Please review:  http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/AcademicIntegrityOfStudents.pdf ) 
• We value learning and realize that technology allows work to be copied easily so we have a strict academic 
integrity policy.   As part of that, we require that all projects be done individually (unless specifically noted) .  
We have found that more individual  learning occurs when students use critical thinking, problem solving skills,  
 course / online resources and a bit of trial and error to work through these projects.   The TAs and I are 
available for project help. To facilitate learning we try to guide you to find your own solutions, rather than just 
tell you an answer .    
• **Do not email your work to anyone else to use as a ‘sample’, or as a copy of the data or share in any way .  
Do not deny them the opportunity to experiment and learn potentially valuable c areer skills.  Also, we use 
software to detect duplicated work.   It is your responsibility  to be sure your project cannot be copied or 
viewed by anyone else.  
• If you share a computer with another person (not recommended) or use a public computer, remove a ny 
project work to a flash drive each time you are done working on the project .  
• All work must be completely your own - no copying, pasting, quotes – just your own words/efforts.  Do not use 
anyone else’s work as a reference.  
• Course Hero / Chegg Policy:  Offer specifics about your policy on contract cheating, paper mills, or the use of 
websites that enable cheating.  Example: The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may not 
use websites that enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This does 
apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – any use of these websites (includ ing uploading 
proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy.  
• Turnitin.com:  In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which instructors 
may use to quickly and easily compare each studen t's assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an 
enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to 
submit specific assignments via the appropriate Canvas / TurnItIn assignment. After the assig nment is 
processed, as instructor I receive a report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was 
used in the assignment. For a more detailed look at this process visit http://www.turnitin.com .  
 
All that being said…  copying, plagiarism or any other form of misrepresentation of one's work is considered 
cheating - this includes cutting/pasting from the Internet or copying anyone else’s p rojects/assignments, or 
sharing solutions in any way. This applies to all course assignments. The minimum penalty for 
collaboration/cheating on an assignment is a zero for that assignment and a referral to the Undergraduate 
Studies Director and Muma Colleg e of Business Undergraduate Program Director.  This is applied to all 
parties involved.  Maximum penalties may include an F or F/F in the course (instructor’s discretion).  Students 
who have been referred for an academic integrity violation in a prior clas s will be subject to an F/F in this class 
in accordance with USF’s academic integrity policies and after discussions with pertinent faculty members, and 
Muma College of Business Undergraduate Advising.  
• College of Business policies do not allow students to drop classes due to academic integrity violations.  
Students will be added back into classes in these situations.  
 
I do not enjoy the ‘academic dishonesty’ part of teaching – it is emotional for all & takes A LOT of time to deal 
with.  However, I do feel very strongly about honesty/integrity and I do uphold University/my course policies 
on cheating.  One survey of IT professionals found that the key attribute they looked for in new hires was 
integrity (above technical skills). I treat academic dishonesty very seriously and will fail students who cheat on 
tests or turn in work that is not completely their own.  See “Academic Dishonesty” in the Undergraduate 
Catalog for further discussion.   
 
If you have questions on academic integrity issues relating to  individual assignments or tests – please contact me, I’ll be 
glad to discuss this in more detail.

• Campus Free Expression: It is fundamenta l to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an 
environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically 
evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find 
uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an 
endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented c an be tested 
by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas  
 are worthy of your personal b elief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas 
and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are 
required to believe it or agree with it.

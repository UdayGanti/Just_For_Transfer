    Team -Based Assignments : 
• System Develo pment and Implementation Plan  (delivered in six (6) parts).  
• Case Studies (total of 4).  
• Team Formation – Teams have been set by random assignment : 
o Teams have either 3 or  4 members. One member has been randomly assigned a s lead the team .  
o Each t eam must choose a name and a motto  by the end of week 1 . Your team name should be your 
“brand.”  Your team motto should reflect what you wish to accomplish duri ng this semester.  
o The team lead will be responsible for delivering your products and for coordinating team meetings 
and member tasks.  
o Teams must deliver a weekly report to the instructor.  Report contains who attended, time 
started/ended, tasks assigned to whom  for next week, tasks completed from whom from last week.  
 Individual Assignments:   
• Team Member Rating , 360 feedback.  
• Computer software installation and use (Visio, Project, Wireframes)  
 
 Grading:   
 
 
Grading Rubric : Expectations (How your work will be judged):  
 
• This course is designed to enforce  the rigor of analysis and design,  and the documentation process associated 
with it, as applied to the application of IS and IT to business . As such, you will be assessed based on quality 
of your work, thoroughness in your treatment of the subject matter, presentation, and content.  
• I have one standard that I use to judge your work: Would Muma College of Business  be embarrassed that 
you took this to your jo b interview?  
• To give you some guidance for what I consider to be acc eptable work for university level , I have put together 
a list of items for your review. Every item on this list has been observed by me in at least one RFP, RFI, 
RFQ, or other requirements -based document instruction in industry practice.  
• By having all submitted documents consistent  with a standard format, it is easier to compare similar work 
between members and teams , as well as for the University and College to report our educational work 
product to assessment authorities.  
• Formatting is important. Your work may be 100% correct, but if presented in the wrong format, or difficult 
for the reviewer to read, it might receive negative feedback, up to and including, rejection for failure to 
follow directions.  
• Failure to comply wit h this list of items may result in a rejection of your submission .  
a. Submissions must be typed, using Times New Roman, 12 -point font, with double space.  
b. Every individual written assignment should have a cover page containing your name, assignment title, 
date and course name. NO OTHER items should be on your cover page.  
c. Every team -based written assignment shall have only one submission  - from the team lead . The cover 
page must identify the team lead and all team members listed in alphabetical order; it must state your 
team name and motto , specific assignment and due date.  No other items should be on your team cover 
page.  
d. Loose pages will not be accepted. Multiple page documents must be stapled or bound. No other form 
will be accepted.  
e. Your work must be well  organized, using headers and titles to divide paragraphs and sections for clarity . 
You may consider the use of a  variety of fonts and colors ( when appropriate ) for presentation.  
f. You must use complete sentences. Use of bullets only when appropriate for con tent lists.  
g. I should not be the first set of eyes on your paper: Typos and grammatical errors will count against you.  
h. Your work must be thoughtful and demonstrate thorough thinking through of the  problem as well as your 
proposed method for solving  it.  
i.   Your work must be original.  
j. Your work must be accompanied by a reference list of your sources . APA is standard, but any style is 
accepted as long as it is consistent.  
k. Your work must be easy to read (readability).  
l. Your work must be clear and to the point.  I do not require a minimum amount of content, but you must 
include enough content to demonstrate to me that you have put satisfactory thought and effort into your 5  
 work.  Remember: “Less is not more ”; “less is more value ” – because it does not dilute your m essage 
with too many words.  
m. If your submission does not meet the requirements of the assignment or fails to follow directions  or is far 
off from the requested formatting , it is eligible to be awarded zero credit  or an appropriate reduction for 
missing elem ents. A 20% penalty, per day, is assessed to any document resubmi tted after having been 
graded .  
n. Late work  receives a zero grade until submitted. Any late submission will receive a 20% penalty per day 
until submitted. A day is defined as a 24 -hour cycle co mmencing from the deadline. This means that 
after 5 consecutive days past the deadline, your maximum allowable score is zero. Eastern Time Zone is 
controlling. If you fail to join a canvas group, you will not receive a grade for your team’s 
submissions.  
 
Grading  scale:  The following table explains the grading formula and final letter grades:  
 
WARNING: There is NO extra credit. There is NO rounding. What you get is what you get. 
You have all the assignments before you. There is no additional work available to you if you 
fail to complete the actual assignments in the syllabus.

COMMUNICATION POLICY and PREFERRED METHODS : I follow a standard business day, which 
means 0800 – 1700 , Monday through Friday . I will generally make myself available to you during the business 
day should you wish to call me or video conference with me .  
 
If you choose to contact me through email, the response time will be no later than the close of the next business 
day. This me ans if you send me an email at 0800 on Friday, I will respond to that email no later than 1700 the 
next business day, Monday. Keep this in mind when timing your requests and inquiries.  
 
I do not stand -by on my email server 24/7 waiting for new mail to arr ive in my inbox. In fact, I do not have 
email notifications turned on, I check my email at the start of the business day for whatever arrived during the 
overnight cycle, and then again at the end of the business day for currency.  
 
I have also posted my pe rsonal phone number above for any emergency situation. I completely intend for you to 
use it. Do not hesitate to call me on the phone if you are facing an extreme situation that is causing you stress. I 
am here to support you and get you to the skill level  where you need to be.

Course Description and Objectives  
The past few years have seen an unprecedented explosion in the amount of data 
collected by businesses and have witnessed enabling technologies such as database 
systems, visualization tools and statistical and machine learning algorithms reach 
industrial st rength. These trends have spawned a new breed of business analytics 
systems that go significantly beyond reporting capabilities, to support predictive 
modeling and the extraction of business insights from data. These trends have also 
created a new role of “data scientists” who are professionals with expertise in the 
concepts and tools necessary for the skilled use of these systems. Understanding the 
power and limitations of these technologies can provide business managers and 
information systems professiona ls new approaches to support the task of solving hard 
business problems using data -driven approaches. This course will provide an 
understanding of fundamental data science concepts, techniques and business 
applications.  
General Learning Outcomes  
• Demonstrat e understanding of specific data mining methods  • Describe different ways in which models can be evaluated  
• Use data mining tools to build descriptive and predictive models  
• Analyze a dataset using data analytics methods  
• Describe global business scenarios wher e data and data mining can be applied

Letter Grades (% of total points)  
Scores w ill be rounded up to the next whole point. To adhere to consistency, academic 
integrity, and fairness to everyone, requests for extra points in order to get the next 
higher letter grade for any reason will not be fulfilled. Reasons include, "I need the nex t 
letter grade otherwise my employer won't reimburse my tuition expenses", "I need to 
meet my scholarship requirements", or "It's a matter of cultural pride", etc.  
Exceptions for makeup work are provided only for true, documented emergencies or 
based on gu idance from the University due to any extraordinary circumstances.

controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with 
the permission of any person residing in the residence.  
To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The 
University library and other academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for 
recordings and students with concerns may discuss location of an appropriate  space for the 
recordings with their instructor or advisor.  
Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third -party privacy rights and 
accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party privacy concerns.  
Students are s trictly responsible for ensuring that they take all exams using a reliable 
computer and high -speed internet connection. Setup information will be provided prior to

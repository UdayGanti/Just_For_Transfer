https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1841820/assignments/syllabus 2/8The course provides an overview of the data and information visualization discipline.  Using a hands-on
approach, readings and lectures will cover various visualizations principles and tools.
Expanded Course Description:
As organizations gather and access more and more data, the issue of knowledge management in
general and business intelligence and data analytics in particular takes on an increasing importance for
organizational success. However , while the various business intelligence tools often of fer important
information, in order for such information to be useful from an organizational point of view , it needs to be
presented in a way that is accessible. Data/Information visualization is widely used in several industries,
including business, engineering, and media disciplines to help people analyze and understand what the
data is telling us. The visualization field has grown exponentially over the last few years, and thus there
are more tools available to help us quickly and ef ficiently create compelling ways to understand data.
This course examines how to present insights gained through the application of business intelligence
techniques in the most ef fective way to tell stories that can improve the quality of leadership decisions.
Course Objectives:
At the conclusion of this course, students are expected to be able to:
1. Discuss the importance of data visualization in improving data-driven organizational decision-making.
2. Distinguish between truthful visualizations and misleading visualizations, and discuss what makes a
visualization truthful or misleading.
3. Use data visualization tools to produce quality visualizations.
4. Create visualizations in at least one programming language.
5. Use widely used data visualization tools to clearly , effectively and compellingly communicate insights
to improve organizational decision making.

Grading
You will be assessed using a number of dif ferent assessment tools, including
A number of smaller projects.
Initial posts in discussion forums.
Participation in Classroom discussions.
The larger project in which you will conduct data analysis and data visualization on a data set,
preferably of your own choosing, and
A reflective essay on what you learned in the course and how you could use the competencies
acquired in the course in your professional career .
Unless otherwise indicated, the deadline for all the assignments is Monday .  This will give enough time to
grade the assignments so that we discuss any general issues that arise from the assignment in class.
The link of most of the assessments to the course objectives will be clear . The only assessment
instrument that needs justification is the reflective essay . Research (see
e.g. http://www .cmu.edu/teaching/principles/learning.html
(http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/principles/learning.html) ) has shown that learning improves considerably ,
especially for adult students, if students reflect on their learning and how they could use the
competencies and knowledge that they acquired in a course through their own careers. There will be
more details on what to include in the essay later on in the course.
Since the project is such a large part of the overall grade for the course, you are welcome to submit an
early draft of the project, and there will be a number of graded discussions in which you are asked to
report on the progress of your project and on any issues that you may be running into.  The project will
consist of a written report and several visualizations in whatever tool you choose (T ableau or Power BI). 
You will also be asked to make a project presentation, consisting of a 5-minute video.
Your grade will be determined as follows:

Course Policies
Contacting the Instructor:
The easiest way to contact me is through CANV AS. I typically log in at least once a day , and often more
frequently , and this includes weekends. You can also reach me by email as reichgelt@usf.edu or on my
mobile 678-314-4432. I will normally answer you within 24 hours and often more quickly , unless I have
indicated through a course announcement that I may not be able to.  If you want to meet me in person,
please contact me during my of fice hours or make an appointment.
Communications from the Instructor:
In addition to communicating with you in class, I will in general communicate with you through course
emails and course announcements, and it is therefore crucial that you log in at least twice a week to
make sure that there are no new messages from me.  I will also communicate with you by leaving
comments on the various assignments that you complete.  It is important that you read these even if you
earned the maximum grade on the assignment because I often make some comments on how you could
further improve the assignment.
Deadlines:
I will strictly enforce deadlines and will typically not grade work if it is submitted after the deadline. Since
the technology is still not 100% reliable, I would encourage you not to wait until the last moment before
you start working on your assignments. Also, as you are working, please save your work often,
preferably both on your computer and on some back-up storage device, such as a USB drive. In return,
you can expect me to grade your work within 48 hours for the larger assignments and more quickly for
the smaller assignments. 
Chatbots:
The course contains a few assignments that require you to create written documents.  The use of
chatbots to write these documents is not allowed in this course.  If I have evidence that you used a
chatbot, I will give you an F in the course and you will be reported for violating the academic integrity
policy .
University Policies:
USF has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and
grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, religious observances, academic8/7/23, 1:54 PM Syllabus for ISM6419.001F23.81299 Data Visualization

Honor System :
Under the USF Honor System, each student is expected to observe complete honesty in all academic
matters.  V iolation of the Honor System will be referred to the Honor Council.  Note: The following are
violations of the Honor Code:  Copying another student’ s homework, signing another student’ s name on
the attendance roster , copying another group’ s disk or written work, using another student’ s computer
disk to print out your assignment, copying another student’ s file onto your disk, and misrepresenting a
reason for a missed exam.  Punishment for academic dishonesty may result in an automatic “F” or “FF”
in the course or action that may result in suspension or expulsion. See the USF Policy on Academic
Dishonesty & Disruption of the Academic Process at https://www .usf.edu/graduate-
studies/students/academic-integrity-of-students  (https://www.usf.edu/graduate-
studies/students/academic-integrity-of-students/)

Please notify your instructor by the second week if you have a learning disability or require special
assistance with this course.  For additional information about academic accommodations and resources,
you can visit the SAS website at https://www .usf.edu/student-affairs/student-accessibility/
(https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-accessibility/)

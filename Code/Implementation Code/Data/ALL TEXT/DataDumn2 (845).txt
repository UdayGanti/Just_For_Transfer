Knack Tutoring
The USF Muma College of Business has partnered with Knack to implement a peer tutoring
               program focused on preparing students for the workforce. Knack Tutors are high-achieving
               USF students who have demonstrated excellent leadership potential. Knack allows these
               students to complete a comprehensive training focused on developing key soft skills
               that research has shown to be essential for success in the workplace. Furthermore,
               by tutoring their peers on Knack, they further develop and validate these skills through
               peer feedback.
Learn more about why peer tutors make excellent employees, and email USF's dedicated Knack representative Will Kelly at will@joinknack.com to find out how you can connect with these rockstar students for your internship
               and full-time opportunities.

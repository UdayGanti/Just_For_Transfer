Welcome to International Management! I am looking forward to a great semester and hope you all enjoy this class and learn some useful information. Understanding cross-cultural value differences can be very useful when working with individuals from different countries internationally or with members of different cultures domestically. This is one of the important competencies associated with career readiness. Regardless of the career you choose, it is important to develop your global/intercultural fluency. 
“Global/Intercultural Fluency: Value, respect, and learn from diverse cultures, races, ages, genders, sexual orientations, and religions. The individual demonstrates, openness, inclusiveness, sensitivity, and the ability to interact respectfully with all people and understand individuals’ differences.” (see http://www.naceweb.org/career-readiness/competencies/career-readiness-defined/  An overall objective of this course is to help you develop your global/intercultural fluency. 

Course Description and Purpose:  Examines the effects of international cultural differences on business practices within and outside the United States and provides methods to build synergies and establish/enhance competitive advantage via those differences. This course is designed to challenge you to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways in which culture affects management decisions; to examine more closely your own assumptions, values, and beliefs and consider how they may affect cross-cultural management situations; and to become more familiar with the values of different countries, cultures, and their management styles.  International Management is an eclectic field which emphasizes culture’s effect on the managerial process and is based on disciplines such as the following:  anthropology, psychology, sociology, religion, history, and political science. 

Course Prerequisite:  MAN 3025, Principles of Management with a minimum grade of C. 
Restriction: Senior Standing

How to Succeed in this Course
Given the complexity of international management, it is very important to thoroughly read all the assigned readings in the text while focusing on the study guides provided. These chapters include a ton of information, and I will not regurgitate everything in the text. Instead, I will go over the highlights of chapters, clarify confusing concepts and provide examples. Take the time to go through the practice exam questions that are posted in Canvas. Listen to all video lectures while looking through the PowerPoints paying special attention to any notes in the PowerPoints (look at the notes view). Some students benefit from re-reading the chapters before the exam. Making and studying flash cards of key terms and the definitions may also be helpful. Take the Honorlock practice quiz to familiarize yourself with Honorlock at the beginning of the semester. The supplemental videos, discussion boards and international spotlight cases included in each module provide examples of material in the textbook and help students to delve deeper into the course topics. Be sure to submit your discussion board posts and international spotlight cases on time to get full credit. Late submissions lose 10 points per day.

Exams: (3 @25% each) There will be 3 midterm exams.  Exam questions can be based on material covered in any aspect of class (e. g. reading assignments, lectures, PowerPoints, cases, and supplemental videos). The format of the exams will be multiple-choice questions. Study guides and practice questions for the exams will be posted and review will be available to those who are interested.

Cases: (10%) We don’t have many in person classes, but please come to class prepared and ready to participate! Please answer case questions completely and concisely. Do not answer questions with just a “no” or “yes” answer. Please elaborate. Late assignments will be penalized 10 points/day, so please prepare ahead of time to allow for emergency situations such as illness or computer problems. Submissions with numerous typos/ grammatical errors cannot earn a grade higher than a “C”, so please check your papers for errors. The write-ups of the cases for each chapter are due each week by Sunday at midnight except for a few days in which we meet in class.  Please include citations or URLs for any websites or other materials you use to answer the case questions. Researching and including supplemental material in addition to the case information is strongly encouraged. A rubric is included on Canvas. 

You are allowed to work on these together if you desire but do turn in your own copy of the completed answers. If you work with others, do include the group member names on the paper.  In general, there are no wrong or right answers to many of these questions but do show that you put effort and thought into learning about the associated issues. Hopefully, these cases will be an interesting and fun and help you to go beyond the theories in the book and learn more about specific countries. Some cases are designed to help you gain insight into international management situations that might arise and how you would react.

Discussion Boards: (10%)
In order to earn participation points, you must get involved.  Responding to these discussion board posts by the deadlines will earn you participation points.  Late assignments are penalized 10 points per day and will be accepted up to 10 days late for partial credit. You can probably still earn an “A” if you miss one assignment due to computer problems, illness, work issues, etc. You are also required to respond in a thoughtful and polite manner to at least one other student for each discussion board. Do take the time to read the Netiquette Guide posted on Canvas regarding professional online interactions. Questions regarding clarification of assignments or any personal questions should be emailed to me directly. Articulating your opinions and ideas and sharing relevant examples based on your experiences will enhance the learning experience for everyone and deepen your understanding of the material.  Also, please feel free to point out any relevant news that related to the class. Professional behavior is always expected during this course.  Please try to maintain a positive attitude and respect your professor and other students. Please include citations in APA format for any websites or other materials you use in your discussion post. A rubric is included on Canvas. The write-ups of the discussion boards are due each week by Sunday at midnight, and most weeks will have a discussion board due.

Quizzes: (5%) Chapter quizzes only count 4%. The quizzes test your knowledge of the chapter material and help you prepare for the exam. Quiz questions are in multiple-choice format. Honorlock is used. The quizzes are closed book and no notes or other materials are allowed. 

Optional Project/Presentations: (15%) You can choose to do this project which would substitute for 15% of your exam grade. At the end of the semester, we will have group or individual presentations related to a specific country. Groups will have approximately 4 students. Each group will have approximately 8 minutes to present. A separate handout with more information will be provided. You will need to decide whether or not you are going to do this project and present it by 10/28. Depending on how many people are interested in doing the project, we may have time for individual presentations, but that will be up to you and will depend on whether or not you can find group members. If you do poorly on exams or just want the extra challenge of doing a project this might be a good option for you. It is designed to give students another option besides having a large portion of your grade dependent on exams. 

Late or missed assignments or exams:  It is expected that all assignments will be completed and submitted by the due dates specified on the class schedule. Exams are to be taken within the date range indicated on the class syllabus.  
If you are unable to take an exam during the scheduled date range due to circumstances known in advance (e.g. an unavoidable school/work event), you must make arrangements with me to take the exam before the scheduled exam date.  Otherwise, only extreme emergencies that can be verified will be accepted as an excuse for missing the exam (in the event of an illness, a note from the doctor explicitly indicating that the student should not attend class is mandatory).  In the event of an emergency, it is your responsibility to contact me as soon as possible after the emergency (worst case, within 24 hours of the exam you missed). Make-up exams may be any format.    

Classroom Devices/Student Recording: During exams calculators, tape recorders, cell phones, notes, books and other student-owned audio & technology devices are NOT allowed. All videos and other course materials are proprietary, and should not be shared, posted or used in any way outside of the current class. 

Canvas: This course will be offered via USF's learning management system (LMS), Canvas. If you need help learning how to perform various tasks related to this course or other courses being offered in Canvas, please consult the Canvas help guide (https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student/gh-p/student). You may also contact USF's IT department at (813) 974-1222 or help@usf.edu. It is strongly advised that you login to Canvas and print out your syllabus right away. Keep it handy so you don’t miss any deadlines-especially the exams. Put the exam dates on your calendar, and don’t forget to login to Canvas to check announcements daily if possible. Please keep up with course announcements in Canvas that include important course reminders and other information that will be helpful in succeeding in this class. 

Online Proctoring: Quizzes will be conducted using an online proctoring tool called Honorlock. Keeping the audio and video (microphone and camera) on during such exams and quizzes is a must. If the student is not willing to use these, the student is asked not to register for this course. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period. Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the residence. To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University library and other academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for recordings, and students with concerns may discuss the location of an appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third-party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third-party privacy concerns. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. For additional information about online proctoring you can visit the online proctoring student FAQ at https://www.usf.edu/innovative-education/digital-learning/digital-learning-resources/honor_lock.aspx

Class Recording: Exam reviews will be recorded and posted online. Student’s voice and video may be included in the class recording. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure the privacy of their surroundings and background is maintained.

Covid 19 University Policies: https://www.usf.edu/coronavirus/

Campus Free Expression (standard USF policy verbiage):
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive. 

In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research. 

Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.

Policies about accessibility, religious observances, academic grievances, academic misconduct, and several other topics are governed by a central set of policies, which apply to all classes at USF: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspx

Copyrights:  It is acceptable to tape the lectures and to take notes for personal use, but it is unacceptable to sell them to another person or to a company that specializes in the sale of class notes. 

Incomplete Grades: An “I” grade may be given to an undergraduate student only when a small portion of the student’s work (normally 30% or less) is incomplete due to circumstances beyond the control of the student and only when a student is otherwise earning a passing grade.  “I” grades are to be used only in emergency situations and cannot to be used as a means of avoiding a poor grade. Normally these are only for medical emergencies and require a signed letter from a medical professional that the student was prevented from attending class. The student must petition the professor before the week of final exams for a grade of “I” to be given.
The time limit for removing the “I” is to be set by the instructor of the course. For undergraduate students, this time limit may not exceed two academic semesters, whether or not the student is in residence, and/or graduation, whichever comes first. 

Course Prerequisite and Grade Requirements:  Prerequisite course name and number (if any), and any special grade requirements regarding passing certain courses with a “C” or better (for some majors); or a “C-“ or better (required for graduation for College of Business core courses).

Withdrawal: No “W” grades can be obtained after the official drop or withdrawal date (indicate date for each semester). All students enrolled as of the withdrawal date (indicate date for each semester), will receive a letter grade of A, B+, B, C, C+, C, D+, D or F.

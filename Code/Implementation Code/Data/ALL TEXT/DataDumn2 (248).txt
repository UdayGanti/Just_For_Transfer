Virtual Tour

The Muma College of Business is home to six schools which serve students throughout
               the Tampa Bay region.  In Tampa, the Muma College of Business offers undergraduate,
               graduate, and doctoral programs.  Business faculty and classrooms are largely in three
               buildings on Tampa campus, including Ferguson Hall (often referred to as "the bunker,"
               due to the fact that part of the building is underground) which is home to the Tampa
               campus' largest auditorium, the Marketing & Sales Innovation lab, the Collier Student
               Success Center and most faculty offices for the School of Marketing and Innovation
               and the Lynn Pippenger School of Acountancy. Quinn Hall (often referred to as the
               "newer building") includes a spacious atrium with a 32-screen video wall, a multi-purpose
               room, the college's boardroom, a smaller auditorium and smaller classrooms. The Communications
               and Information Sciences building, where the most of the School of Information Systems
               and Management faculty offices are housed, also includes some classrooms and small
               gathering spaces.
Tampa is home to top global companies, a burgeoning entrepreneurial scene and a thriving
               job market that includes a metropolitan downtown area, the Westshore business district
               and a number of suburban communities. Tampa consistently tops the state in job creation
               and job demand, particularly in fast-growing industries such as cybersecurity, advanced
               manufacturing, healthcare administration, financial services and more.  The university's
               proximity to a myriad of suburban clusters provides many opportunities for student
               internships, part-time jobs, and cooperative education experiences relevant to students'
               career goals.  
Regardless of campus location, the business community plays a key role in the Muma
               College of Business' educational programs.  Business leaders serve on advisory boards
               as entrepreneurs, mid-level managers and seasoned executives partner with the college
               to share relevant, real-time scenarios and learning opportunities with students, doing
               so alongside faculty experts whose lessons bridge theory and practice.

 1/5/23, 6:30 AM Syllabus for ISM7406.080S23.24725 Business Analytics
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1790572/assignments/syllabus 2/10University Course Description:
 
A research course for executives that presents an overview of data analytics techniques as well as
examples of analytics research in business. A variety of analytics technique including structured data,
unstructured data and big data will be discussed..
 
 
Course Structure:
 
Classroom session : Class meetings include lectures, discussions, team presentations and in-class
projects.
 
Assignments:  Assignments will be structured around readings, used to develop team presentations, and
analytics exercises. Participants will also submit entries to the international Kaggle Competition for data
analytics.
 
 
Course Objectives:
 
This course focuses more on the implementation of analytical concepts for solving real-world data
science projects (rather than the discussion of new concepts and methods). In fact, this course has two
objectives:
1. to provide a high-level appreciation of analytics via the discussion of case studies and students' own
experiences on what it takes for a company to become an analytical competitor
2. to expose students to some real-world challenges of analytics via hands-on participation &
implementation of an analytics project – in the form of a world-wide data science competition
 
 
 
Learning Outcomes:1/5/23, 6:30 AM Syllabus for ISM7406.080S23.24725 Business Analytics
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1790572/assignments/syllabus 3/10 
Upon completing this course, the participant should be able to:
 
Identify an underlying analytical structure in a seemingly complex and amorphous decision problem
Understand the trade-of fs involved in the decision
Understand the role of uncertainty and risk in the decision-making process
Analyze available data to understand relationships among variables and to create predictions
Use available computing technology to arrive at optimal solutions.
 
 
Required Course Materials:
 
We will use two dif ferent books for this course. The books will be used simultaneously in that one book
covers strategic aspects of business analytics from a high-level point of view; the other book has more of
an operational flavor in that it conveys hands-on ideas for data-modeling. The two books are
 
Business Analytics for Managers by Jank, Springer , 201 1 (ISBN 978-1-4614-0405-7).
Competing on Analytics by Davenport and Harris, Harvard Business School Press, 2007 (ISBN 142-
2-1033-23)
 
Other materials:  Download papers, slides, and assignments from Canvas.
 
Interactive Polling
In addition to the above two books, we will also make extensive use of Poll Everywhere during lectures
and activities. For more information, go to http://polleverywhere.com  (http://polleverywhere.com)
 
Data Mining Software
We will use the software R Commander for analyzing and mining our data. R Commander is based on
the open-source project R. R is free and it grows much faster than any commercial software solution. R
isoneofthemost powerful andpopular software solutions formining business data Infact large1/5/23, 6:30 AM Syllabus for ISM7406.080S23.24725 Business Analytics
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1790572/assignments/syllabus 4/10is one of the most powerful and popular software solutions for mining business data. In fact, large
analytical companies such as Google or A T&T use R. R is also becoming more and more popular among
government agencies (such as the DOD). R is powerful,  yet it is free – this combination makes it a
winning proposition for many companies, especially during times of tightening budgets and financial
stress.
 
Installing the software R Commander:  Please see the course Module 0 for instructions on how to
download and install R Commander
 
Information on the data visualization software Tableau  is also presented in an optional Canvas module.
We will not be covering the software in the course but have added the links owing to past student
interest.
 
 
Assignments and Activities
 
Team Research and Discussion
Every meeting, a dif ferent team (or set of teams) will take the lead discussing select chapters from the
text “Competing on Analytics.” Please refer to the detailed weekly schedule at the end of this syllabus.
The team(s) will prepare a short presentation (based on a set of questions that I will distribute) and
present their answers and solutions in class. While the presentation is primarily lead by one team of
students, the remaining class is also encouraged to share additional/alternate views.
 
Quizzes & Practice Quizzes
Several times throughout the course, individual assignments/quizzes will be due. The primary purpose of
these assignments is for students to have the opportunity to practice the concepts learned in class, and
to implement them using real data and real software. Individual assignments are expected to be solved
rather quickly and not to consume much of your time. Careful participation during the in-class projects
will allow you to solve the individual assignments more ef ficiently .
 
Analytics Project
Kaggle Data Science Competition: The centerpiece of this course will be for you to participate in a data
science competition. The competition is hosted by Kaggle (www .kaggle.com ) which is an online
community ofdata scientists andwhich hosts private andpublic data science competitions Thegoal of1/5/23, 6:30 AM Syllabus for ISM7406.080S23.24725 Business Analytics
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1790572/assignments/syllabus 5/10community of data scientists and which hosts private and public data science competitions. The goal of
this competition is to gain hands-on experience with the execution and implementation of real data
science projects. As part of this analytics project, you will have several quizzes and online discussions to
complete over the progression of this course.
 
 
Attendance & Class Participation
 
Effective participation consists of not only responding to questions raised by the instructor but also
asking thoughtful questions and responding to contributions from your fellow-students.
 
 Quality of participation is more important than quantity .  However , you will not earn credit in this
component, if you rarely speak in class.  Quality of participation includes:
 
Evidence of reading and prior analysis;
Relevance of comments;
Ability to listen and relate to input from other students;
Ability to lead discussion into previously unexplored areas;
Ability to admit error;
Ability to intellectually interact with other students (and not just the instructor).
 
Special emphasis will be placed on participation during the in-class projects.

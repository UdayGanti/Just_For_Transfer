Course Context (additional description)  
Cyber -attacks cost the global economy $445 billion annually and affect a variety of 
domains such as healthcare, government, academia, and industry. Recent years have seen 
an unfortunate and  disruptive growth in the number of cyber -attacks. To stem this grand 
societal issue, there are increasing calls for well -trained cybersecurity professionals, with 
an estimated 3.5 million cybersecurity job openings by 2021. Despite this high demand, 
there  is currently a severe shortage of qualified candidates. Specifically, individuals lack 
technical skills such as planning/implementing/upgrading/monitoring emerging 
technologies, incident response, security controls, and basic systems administration. 
Moreo ver, candidates often lack the non -technical skills of researching and reading new 
technologies, regulatory compliance, internal security policies, standards, and procedures. 
This hands -on, introductory, graduate -level course, backwards engineered with 
DHS /NSA key knowledge unit requirements for maintaining the Center for Academic 
Excellence for Cyber Defense (CAE -CD) at USF, aims to alleviate these concerns and 
help students be prepared to become competitive candidates  in the information security 
industry . 
 
 
 Prerequisite Requirements  
Technical Requirements: Full -time access to a personal computer . A basic understanding 
of computers. This includes basic , cursory knowledge of systems administration, shell 
scripting, and computer networking.  
 
Course Workload  Expectations  
Any university course requires a large amount of work outside of lecture. This course is 
structured around 16 weeks. You should expect a normal to heavy workload. This is a 
fast-paced  course! We assume you will allocate an average of at least  6-8 hours per week 
outside of lecture for study, quiz, and assignment work. It is your responsibility to 
manage your workload. If you procrastinate, you may find that you do not have enough 
time, or that a technology problem is preventing you from complet ing your submissions 
on time. Note that technology problems (such as computer or network failures) will not 
be accepted as acceptable excuses .

**In the interests of the class, deviations may be made in the coverage of topics as outlined in the 
tentative course calendar. However, to help plan your calendars for the rest of the semester, 
assessment and deadline dates will be non -negotiable after the first day of class. Some deadlines may be 
clubbed together to accommodate schedules.  
***All deliverables are due at the end of day (11:59 PM) on the submission date (usually Sunday).  
Attendance Discussion Assignment  To meet USF’s First Day Attendance requ irement, please complete the discussion 
attendance assignment that has been set up in Canvas. Please complete the discussion 
requirement before Thursday, August 27, 2023, at 11:59 PM . Part of the discussion 
assignment is introducing yourself to the rest of  the class. Your discussion response will 
be used as an a cknowledgement you wish to remain  enrolled  in the course. If you do not 
complete the discussion assignment you will be administratively dropped from our 
course.  
 
Late Work Policy  
Assignments turned in late to Canvas are assessed a penalty of a ten percent deduction for 
every 24 hours  of being late , for up to a maximum of fifty percent deduction . For 
example, if a student turns in an assignment less than 24 hours late, a 10  percent point 
penalty  is assessed; and if a student turns in an assignment between 48 -72 hours late, a 30 
percent penalty is assessed. The latest an assignment will be  accepted is 7 days after the 
due date .  
 
The said penalties will be in addition to normal deductions of points for failure to do the 
assignment correctly.  Times of assignment uploads are recorded by Canvas and reported 
to the professor.  
 
Should you wish to discuss the grading and points awarded for any assignment your 
professor is happy to acc ommodate you.  However, you must do so within two weeks of 
the graded assignment being returned to you via Canvas.  If you do not discuss such with 
your professor within the two -week window the professor will assume you are satisfied 
with the grading of th e assignment  and will consider the points awarded to be final.  After 
the two -week window no discussions of points awarded on an assignment will be 
entertained.  
 
 
Extra Credit Policy  
There are no opportunities for extra credit in this course.  Students’ f ocus should be on 
the primary work in the course.  
 
Medical Issues   
There are certainly cases in which a student legitimately cannot complete course 
assignments for valid medical reasons.  To be excused from course work in such cases 
requires students to fu rnish a standard note from a health care professional stating care is 
being sought for an ailment or condition which can impede a student’s ability to complete 
course work.  Without such a note an excuse from course work cannot be granted.  
 
Grades of "Inco mplete"  
An Incomplete grade ("I") is exceptional and granted at the instructor’s discretion only 
when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other 
circumstances beyond their control. The course instructor and student must co mplete and 
sign the "I" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is 
due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete 
assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instruc tor as long 
as it does not exceed two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate courses from the original date grades were due for that course. An "I" grade not 
cleared within the two semesters for undergraduate courses and one seme ster for graduate 
courses (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract.  
 
Academic Integrity and Academic Misconduct  
Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida System’s 
commitment to the academic ho nesty and personal integrity of its university community. 
Academic integrity is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, 
respect, and fairness. Broadly defined, academic honesty is the completion of all 
academic endeavors and claims o f scholarly knowledge as representative of one’s own 
efforts. The final decision on an academic integrity violation and related academic 
sanction at any USF System institution shall affect and be applied to the academic status 
of the student throughout the  USF System, unless otherwise determined by the 
independently accredited institution.   The process for faculty reporting of academic 
misconduct, as well as the student’s options for appeal, are outlined in detail in USF 
System Regulation 3.027.  
 
In our course assignments , the professor has several methods for penalizing those who 
engage in academic misconduct.  Among these  methods the professor can 1) award 0 
points for an assignment on which a student has engaged in misconduct, 2) award an F in 
the entire course, or 3) award a special FF grade in the course.  An FF appears 
permanently on the student's transcript as a speci al designation showing the student failed 
the course for reasons of academic misconduct.   The FF includes expulsion from the 
University.  
 
Web Posting Course Materials  
Students are reminded that posting course materials to third -party sites such as Course 
Hero or Chegg represents a violation of the professor’s copyright on those materials and 
constitutes theft of intellectual property.    
 
Disruption to Academic Process  
Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Disruption of 
the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a 
classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the 
instructor: (a) directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy 
distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic 
discussion, or general University operati ons, or (b) presents a danger to the health, safety, 
or well -being of self or other persons.  
 
Student Academic Grievance Procedures  
The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students 
taking courses within the University of South Florida System an opportunity for objective 
review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. An 
“academic grievance” is a claim that a specific academic decision or action that affects 
that student’s academic record or status has violated published policies and procedures or 
has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students.  
 
Attendance Policy  Students are expected to exhibit professionalism through regular and on -time attendance 
to class lectures, whether those lectures are offered live or online. Accommodation will 
be made for excused absences by making arrangements with students ahead of time 
(when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work .   
 
Group Work Policy:  
No g roup work is allowable according the guidance provided earlier in this document.  
 
Final Examinations Policy:  
All final exams are to be scheduled in accordance with the University’s final examination 
policy.  
 
 
Course Policies: Technol ogy and Media  
 
Netiquette Guidelines  
1. Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers 
with respect, the same way you would do in a face -to-face environment. Respect other 
people’s ideas and be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not 
agree with.   
2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. 
There will be people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and 
religious beliefs or other general differences.   
3. Proofread and check spelling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a 
thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and 
thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, 
and it is more difficult to read.  
4. Keep your communications focused and stay on topic. Complete your ideas 
before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to 
easily get your idea or answers they are looking for.  
5. Be clear with your message. Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can’t 
see your expressions or hear your tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.  
 
Email  
The primary means of communication between instructor and students between live class 
meetings  will be email.  “Blast emails” will occasionally be sent by the instructor to all 
students via Canvas.  Students can feel free to email their instructor with questions at any 
time.  Please anticipate a response time of 24 hours to email queries.   
 
Laptop  Usage  
Laptop/Tablet usage is highly encouraged in this course given the nature of the mater ial.  
Students are responsible for making certain their technology is appropriate to the needs of 
program and is in good working order for class lectures and assig nments.    
 
Phone Usage:  Students are allowed to use devices for recording lectures for their personal use, though 
students must still adhere to classroom behavioral expectations while recording. Students 
attending the in -person lectures are asked to place their mobile phones on “ silent” and to 
step outside the classroom to take any important calls.  Phones may not be used during 
in-class assignments.  
 
Recordings   
In this class, software will be used to record live class lectures and discussions. As a 
student in this class, your p articipation in live class discussions will be recorded. These 
recordings will be made available only to students enrolled in the class, to assist those 
who cannot attend the live session or to serve as a resource for those who would like to 
review content  that was presented. Students who prefer to participate via audio only will 
be allowed to disable their video camera so only audio will be captured. Please discuss 
this option with your instructor .  
 
Canvas  
This course will be offered via USF's learning m anagement system (LMS), Canvas. 
Canvas will be used in this course to disseminate materials turn in weekly assignments 
and return graded assignments.  If you need help learning how to perform various tasks 
related to this course or other courses being offe red in Canvas, please view the following 
videos or consult the Canvas help guides. You may also contact USF's IT department at 
(813) 974 -1222 or help@usf.edu . 
 
Online Exam Proctoring  
All students  must  review  the syllabus  and the requirements,  including  the online  terms  
and video  testing  requirements,  to determine  if they wish  to remain  in the course.  
Enrollment  in the course  is an agreement  to abide  by and accep t all terms.  Any student  
may elect  to drop or withdraw  from  this course  before  the end of the drop/add  period.   
Online  exams  and quizzes  within  this course  may require  online  proctoring.  Therefore,  
students  will be required  to have  a webcam  (USB  or internal)  with a microphone  when  
taking  an exam  or quiz.  Students  understand  that this remote  recording  device  is 
purchased  and controlled  by the student  and that recordings  from  any private  residence  
must  be done  with the permission  of any person  residing  in the residence.   
To avoid  any concerns  in this regard,  students  should  select  private  spaces  for the testing.  
Students  with concerns  may discuss  location  of an appropriate  space  for the recordings  
with their instructor  or advisor.  Students  must  ensure  that any recordings  do not invade  
any third -party  privacy  rights  and accept  all responsibility  and liability  for violations  of 
any third -party  privacy  concerns.  Students  are strictly  responsible  for ensuring  that they 
take all exams  using  a reliable  compute r and high-speed  internet  connection.  Setup  
information  will be provided  prior  to taking  the proctored  exam.  To use Honorlock,  
students  are required  to download  and install  the Honorlock  Google  Chrome  extension . 
For additional  information  please  visit the USF  onlin e proctoring  student  
FAQ  and Honorlock  student  resources .   
 
WhatsApp, GroupMe, and Student -to-Student Communication  
While students may use digital communication tools (WhatsApp, Slack, GroupMe, etc.) 
to communicate with fellow students, it is important to remember that academic integrity 
policies still apply in these environments. Informing others about the contents of tests is prohibited by the official regulation , as is receiving unauthorized information about an 
examination. Students are expected and required to immediately re port instances of such 
violations to the instructor.  
 
 
 
Course Policies: Student Expectations  
Title IX Policy  
Title IX provides federal protections for discrimination based on sex, which includes 
discrimination based on pregnancy, sexual harassment, and i nterpersonal violence. In an 
effort to provide support and equal access, USF has designated all faculty (TA, 
Adjunct, etc.) as Responsible Employees, who are required to report any disclosures 
of sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship violence or  stalking.  The Title IX 
Office makes every effort, when safe to do so, to reach out and provide resources and 
accommodations, and to discuss possible options for resolution.   Anyone wishing to 
make a Title IX report or seeking accommodations may do so onli ne, in person, via 
phone, or email to the Title IX Office. For information about Title IX or for a full list of 
resources please visit:  https://www.usf.edu/title -ix/gethelp/resou rces.aspx . If you are 
unsure what to do, please contact Victim Advocacy – a confidential resource that can 
review all your options – at 813 -974-5756 or  va@admin.usf.edu . 
 
Course Hero / Chegg Policy  
The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may not use websites that 
enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This 
does apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – almost any use of these 
websites (including uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the 
academic integrity policy.  
 
Professionalism Policy  
Per university policy and classroom etiquette; mobile phones, iPods, etc. must be 
silenced  during all classroom and lab lectures. Those not heeding this rule will be asked 
to leave the classroom/lab immediately so as to not disrupt the learning environment. 
Please arrive on time for all class meetings. Students who habitually disturb the class by 
talking, arriving late, etc., and have been warned may suffer a reduction in their final 
class grade.  
 
End of Semester Student Evaluations  
All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide feedback to the 
University regarding the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of the 
semester, and the University will notify you by email when the response window opens. 
Your participation is highly encouraged and valued.  
 
Food and Drink Policy  
Please adhere to the firm poli cy of no beverages (other than bottled/capped water), food, 
tobacco products, or like items in the classroom. Your understanding of the necessity for 
this policy and cooperation will be greatly appreciated. This policy will be strictly 
enforced.   
Turnitin .com  
In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which 
instructors may use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions 
of web sites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each 
submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all assignments in both hard 
copy and electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a 
report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work wa s used in the 
assignment. For a more detailed look at this process visit http://www.turnitin.com . Essays 
are due at turnitin.com the same day as in class.  
 
Disability Access  
Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Students with Disabilities 
Services (SDS) to receive academic accommodations. SDS encourages students to notify 
instructors of accommodation requests at least 5 business days prior to needing the 
accommodation. A letter from SDS must accompany this request.  
 
Religious Observances  
All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate their 
religious observances, practices and beliefs. If you observe religious holid ays, you should 
plan your allowed absences to include those dates.  
 
Campus Free Expression   
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment 
where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically 
evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussio n of ideas 
that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and 
not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the 
idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the 
idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may 
decide that certain ideas are worthy of  your personal belief. In this course, however, you 
may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the 
ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree 
with it . 
 
 
 
Make -up Exams Polic y  
If a student cannot be present for an examination for a valid reason (validity to be 
determined by the instructor), a make -up exam will be given only if the student has 
notified the instructor in advance that s/he cannot be present for the exam. Make -up 
exams are given at the convenience of the instructor .  
 
Rewrites Policy   Rewrites are entirely optional; however, only the formal essay may be rewritten for a 
revised grade. Note that an alternate grading rubric will be used for the rewrite, featuring 
an additional column that evaluates the changes made specifically . 
 
Exams Retention P olicy   
After exams are graded, the instructor will review the examination with the class and 
collect all exams. The exams will be retained for one semester following the curr ent one, 
and then they will be destroyed . 
 
Exams Retention P olicy   
After exams are graded, the instructor will review the examination with the class and 
collect all exams. The exams will be retained for one semester following the current one, 
and then they  will be destroyed . 
 
Essay Commentary Policy  
Commentary on essays will be delivered in written format, at the end of the essay. 
However, upon request, an alternate delivery method can be used. If desired, instructor 
comments will be made verbally and delivered to the student as an mp3 through Canvas. 
This approach yields far fewer written comments, but much more commentary in general 
is delivered, due to the speed and specificity of speech. Those requesting mp3 feedback 
must state so when the essay is turned in.  
 
Learning Support and Campus Offices

Perks & Discounts
The Employee Perks & Discounts Program is just one of many benefits offered at USF. Faculty and staff can receive
               various discounts for goods, services and recreation.
USF Human Resources has provided this list of links because they contain information
               which may be of interest to our USF employees. We offer these links without endorsement.
               Individuals who choose to use the links should understand that they are offered only
               as a convenience and USF takes no responsibility for the accuracy of the information
               provided at these sites

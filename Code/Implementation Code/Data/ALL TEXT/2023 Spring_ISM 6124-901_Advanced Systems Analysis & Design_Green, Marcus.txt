Course Logistics and Communications  
• All email communication sent to me will be through Canvas messaging  (email). This 
allows me to repository all communications through canvas as opposed to my normal 
email. Using Canvas messaging also automatically adds o ur course information to all 
communications, which allows me to quickly identify both student and course enrolled.  
• For all deliverables requiring email communication, it is required to use Canvas 
messaging  (email); You will lose credit for not doing s o. 
• For questions about the course content or any assignment, please utilize scheduled office 
hours, or call for an appointment. You can also contact me via email.  
• All work should be completed using professional standards. Assignments will be 
submitted via Canv as and submitted to Turnitin.  Please ensure that you cite any material 
referenced appropriately. If you have any question, please do not hesitate to ask for 
clarification or assistance.  
• To improve the efficiency and effectiveness in delivering course cont ent, each student 
will be responsible for all items contained or emails sent via Canvas.  
• Late Assignments : There are no make -ups for course deliverables. Assignments turned in 
late will be assessed a penalty: a half -letter grade if it is one day late, or a  full-letter grade 
for 2 -7 days late. Assignments will not be accepted if overdue by more  than seven days. 
Deliverables are due by the end of day on the due date (usually this means Sunday 
11:59pm).  
• Re-grade Policy  - All tests and other graded material may  be submitted for re -evaluation 
of the grade by the instructor.  To request a re -grade, you must submit a written request 
within one week of the date the test or assignment was returned.  The written request 
must include a cover sheet that explains (1) The  specific test questions or aspects of the 
assignment that you want re -evaluated and  (2) Why the original grade is in error and 
should be reconsidered.  
• In the event of an emergency, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through 
methods that incl ude but are not limited to: Canvas, MS Teams, Skype, and email 
messaging and/or an alternate schedule. It’s the responsibility of the student to monitor 
Canvas for each class for course specific communication, and the main USF, College, 
and department webs ites, emails, and MoBull messages for important general 
information .

**In the interests of the class, deviations may be made in the coverage of topics as outlined in the 
tentative course calendar. However, to help plan your calendars for the rest of the semester, 
assessment and deadline dates will be non-negotiable after the first day of class  
 
Late Work A ssignment s 
Assignments turned in late to Canvas are assessed a penalty of ten points for every 24 
hours of being late.  For example, if a student turns in an assignment less than 24 hours 
late, they wi ll suffer a 10-point penalt y.  This penalty will be in addition to normal 
deductions of points for failure to do the assignment correctly.  Times of assignment 
uploads are recorded by Canvas and reported to the professor.  
 
Should you wish to discuss the gr ading and points awarded for any assignment your 
professor is happy to accommodate you.  However, you must do so within two weeks of 
the graded assignment being returned to you via Canvas.  If you do not discuss such with 
your professor within the two -week  window the professor will assume you are satisfied 
with the grading of the assignment  and will consider the points awarded to be final.  After 
the two -week window no discussions of points awarded on an assignment will be 
entertained.  
 
Attendance Quiz  
To meet USF’s First Day Attendance requirement a short one -question attendance quiz 
has been set up in Canvas.  Please complete the quiz before Thursday, January 1 2, 2023, 
at 11:59 PM .  If you do not complete the quiz, or if you answer “no” to the single 
question, you will be administratively dropped from our course.  © 202 3 Marcus L. Green  
  
 
 
 
 
Extra Credit Policy  
There are no opportunities for extra credit in this course.  Students’ focus should be on 
the primary work in the course.  
 
Medical Issues   
There are certainly cases in which a student legitimately cannot complete course 
assignments for valid medical reasons.  To be excused from course work in such cases 
requires students to furnish a standard note from a health care professional stating care is 
being sought for an ailment or condition which can impede a student’s ability to complete 
course work.  Without such a note an excuse from course work cannot be granted.  
 
Grades of "Incomplete"  
An Incomplete grade ("I") is exceptional and granted at the instructor’s discr etion only 
when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other 
circumstances beyond their control. The course instructor and student must complete and 
sign the "I" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, th e date it is 
due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete 
assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long 
as it does not exceed two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semes ter for 
graduate courses from the original date grades were due for that course. An "I" grade not 
cleared within the two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate 
courses (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on  the contract . 
 
Academic Standards, Integrity,  and Academic Misconduct  
Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida System’s 
commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its university community. 
Academic integrit y is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, 
respect, and fairness. Broadly defined, academic honesty is the completion of all 
academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as representative of one’s own 
efforts. The final dec ision on an academic integrity violation and related academic 
sanction at any USF System institution shall affect and be applied to the academic status 
of the student throughout the USF System, unless otherwise determined by the 
independently accredited in stitution.   The process for faculty reporting of academic 
misconduct, as well as the student’s options for appeal, are outlined in detail in USF 
System Re gulation 3.027.  
 
In our course assignments , the professor has several methods for penalizing those who 
engage in academic misconduct.  Among these methods the professor can 1) award 0 
points for an assignment on which a student has engaged in misconduct, 2) award an F in 
the entire course, or 3) aw ard a special FF grade in the course.  An FF appears 
permanently on the student's transcript as a special designation showing the student failed © 202 3 Marcus L. Green  
 the course for reasons of academic misconduct.   The FF includes expulsion from the 
University.  
 
All students must review the syllabus and the requirements, including the online terms 
and video testing requirements, to determine if they wish to remain in the course. 
Enrollment in the course is an agreement to abide by and accept all terms. Any student 
may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period.   
 
Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, 
students will be required to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a microphone when 
taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is 
purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence 
must be done with the permission of any person residing in the residence.   
 
To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. 
Students with concerns may discuss location of an appropriate space for the recordings 
with their instructor or advisor.   
 
Students must ensure that any recordings do not invad e any third -party privacy rights and 
accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party privacy concerns.   
 
Committing academic misconduct in this course will result in a failing (F) grade for the 
course.  In such a case the course w ill need to be taken again in order to complete the 
MS-BAIS degree.  Other penalties may be applied by the Muma College of Business.  
Particularly egregious cases will result in a Double -FF (FF) grade being awarded, which 
will lead to expulsion from our pr ogram and the University of South Florida.  
 
Web Posting Course Materials  
Students are reminded that posting course materials to third -party sites such as Course 
Hero or Chegg represents a violation of the professor’s copyright on those materials and 
consti tutes theft of intellectual property.    
 
Disruption to Academic Process  
Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Disruption of 
the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a 
classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the 
instructor: (a) directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy 
distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, acad emic 
discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the health, safety, 
or well -being of self or other persons.  
 
Student Academic Grievance Procedures  
The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students 
taking courses within the University of South Florida System an opportunity for objective 
review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. An 
“academic grievance” is a claim that a specific academic decision or action t hat affects © 202 3 Marcus L. Green  
 that student’s academic record or status has violated published policies and procedures or 
has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students.  
 
Attendance Policy  
Students are expected to exhibit profession alism through regular and on -time attendance 
to class lectures , whether those lectures are offered live or online . Accommodat ion will 
be made for excused absences by making arrangements with students ahead of time 
(when possible) or by providing a reasonab le amount of time to make up missed work.    
 
Group Work Policy  
Everyone must take part in a group project. All members of a group will receive the same 
score; that is, the project is assessed and everyone receives this score. Once formed, 
groups cannot be altered or switched, except for reasons of extended hospitaliza tion. 
 
Final Examinations Policy  
All final exams are to be scheduled in accordance with the University’s final examination 
policy.  
 
Course Policies: Technology and Media  
 
Netiquette Guidelines  
1. Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your i nstructors and peers 
with respect, the same way you would do in a face -to-face environment. Respect other 
people’s ideas and be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not 
agree with.   
2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when  sharing your ideas and opinions. 
There will be people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and 
religious beliefs or other general differences.   
3. Proofread and check spelling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a 
thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and 
thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, 
and it is more difficult to read.  
4. Keep your communications focused and stay on  topic. Complete your ideas 
before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to 
easily get your idea or answers they are looking for.  
5. Be clear with your message. Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can’t 
see you r expressions or hear your tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.  
 
Email  
The primary means of communication between instructor and students between live class 
meetings will be email.  “Blast emails” will occasionally be sent by the instructor to al l 
students via Canvas.  Students can feel free to email their instructor with questions at any 
time.  Please anticipate a response time of 24 hours to email queries.

 Laptop Usage  
Laptop or mobile computing device usage is encouraged during this course. Students are 
allowed to use devices for recording class sessions for personal use.  
 
Phone Usage  
Students are allowed to use devices for recording lectures for their personal use, tho ugh 
students must still adhere to classroom behavioral expectations while recording. Students 
attending the in -person lectures are asked to place their mobile phones on “silent” and to 
step outside the classroom to take any important calls.  Phones may not  be used during 
in-class assignments.

Course Policies: Student Expectations  
 
Title IX Policy  
Title IX provides federal protections for discrimination based on sex, which includes 
discrimination based on pregnancy, sexual harassment, and interpersonal violence. In an 
effort to provide support and equal access, USF has designated all faculty (TA, 
Adjunct, etc.) as Responsible Employees, who are required to report any disclosures 
of sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship violence or stalking.  The Title IX 
Office makes every effort, when safe to do so, to reach out and provide resources and 
accommodations, and to discuss possible options for resolution.   Anyone wishing to 
make a Title IX report or seeking accommodations may do so online, in person, via 
phone, or email to the Title IX Office. For information about Title IX or for a full list of  
resources please visit:  https://www.usf.edu/title -ix/gethelp/resources.aspx . If you are 
unsure what to do, please contact Victim Advocacy – a confidential resource that can 
review all your options – at 813 -974-5756 or  va@admin.usf.edu . 
 
Course Hero / Chegg Policy  
The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may not use websites that 
enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This 
does apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – almost any use of these 
websites (including uploading propriet ary materials) constitutes a violation of the 
academic integrity policy.  
 
Professionalism Policy  
Per university policy and classroom etiquette; mobile phones, iPods, etc. must be 
silenced  during all classroom and lab lectures. Those not heeding this rule  will be asked 
to leave the classroom/lab immediately so as to not disrupt the learning environment. 
Please arrive on time for all class meetings. Students who habitually disturb the class by 
talking, arriving late, etc., and have been warned may suffer a reduction in their final 
class grade.

 End of Semester Student Evaluations  
All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide feedback to the 
University regarding the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of the 
semester, and the University will notify you by email when the response window opens. 
Your participation is highly encouraged and valued.  
 
Food and Drink Policy  
Please adhere to the firm policy of no beverages (other than bottled/capped water), food, 
tobacco products, or like items in the classroom. Your understanding of the necessity for 
this policy and cooperation will be greatly appreciated. This policy will be strictly 
enforced.  
 
Turnitin.com  
In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which 
instructors may use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions 
of web sites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with e ach 
submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all assignments in both hard 
copy and electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a 
report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was used  in the 
assignment. For a more detailed look at this process visit http://www.turnitin.com . Essays 
are due at turnitin.com the same day as in class.  
 
Disability Access  
Students with  disabilities are responsible for registering with Students with Disabilities 
Services (SDS) to receive academic accommodations. SDS encourages students to notify 
instructors of accommodation requests at least 5 business days prior to needing the 
accommoda tion. A letter from SDS must accompany this request.  
Religious Observances  
All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate their 
religious observances, practices and beliefs. If you observe religious holidays, you shoul d 
plan your allowed absences to include those dates.  
 
Campus Free Expression   
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment 
where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically 
evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussio n of ideas 
that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and 
not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the 
idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the 
idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may 
decide that certain ideas are worthy of  your personal belief. In this course, however, you 
may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the © 202 3 Marcus L. Green  
 ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree 
with it . 
 
Make -up Exams Policy   
If a student cannot be present for an examination for a valid reason (validity to be 
determined by the instructor), a make -up exam will be given only if the student has 
notified the instructor in advance that s/he cannot be present for the exam. Make -up 
exams are given at the convenience of the instructor usually on Fridays at 10 am . 
 
Rewrites Policy   
Rewrites are entirely optional; however, only the formal essay may be rewritten for a 
revised grade. Note that an alternate grading rubric will be used for the rewrite, featuring 
an additional column that evaluates the changes made specifically . 
 
Exams Retention P olicy   
After exams are graded, the instructor will review the examination with the class and 
collect all exams. The exams will be retained for o ne semester following the current one, 
and then they will be destroyed .

and then they will be destroyed . 
 
Essay Commentary Policy  
Commentary on essays will be delivered in written format, at the end of the essay. 
However, upon request, an alternate delivery method can be used. If desired, instructor 
comments w ill be made verbally and delivered to the student as an mp3 through Canvas. 
This approach yields far fewer written comments, but much more commentary in general 
is delivered, due to the speed and specificity of speech. Those requesting mp3 feedback 
must st ate so when the essay is turned in.

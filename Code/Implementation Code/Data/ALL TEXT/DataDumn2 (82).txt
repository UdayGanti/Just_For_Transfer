Title IX protects people from sex discrimination in educational programs and activities
               at institutions that receive federal financial assistance (see 20 U.S.C. § 1681 for more information).
Title IX applies to USF programs and activities, as related both to education and
               employment. USF is committed to providing an environment free from sex discrimination,
               including sexual harassment and sexual violence. More information can be found at
               USF's Policy 0-004 Sexual Misconduct/Sex Harassment and the website of the Office of the General Counsel.

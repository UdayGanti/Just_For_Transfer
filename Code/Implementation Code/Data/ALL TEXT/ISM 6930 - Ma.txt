Course
Description
Goal:
This
is
a
practical
course;
the
students
will
be
able
to
use
DL
methods
for
solving
real-world
ML,
CV,
and
NLP
problems.
The
students
will
also
learn
math
and
theories
for
understanding
ML
and
DL.
Broadly ,
we
will
cover
topics
spanning
deep
learning
and
reinforcement
learning.
In
particular ,
we
will
study
popular
deep
learning
architectures,
their
design
choices,
and
how
they
are
trained.This
will
be
motivated
by
business
applications
dealing
with
image
and
text
data.
Finally ,
we
will
look
at
online
and
reinforcement
learning
frameworks
and
their
role
in
sequential
decision-making
settings
such
as
retail.
The
(tentative)
list
of
topics
we
will
cover
in
this
course
is:
●
Deep
learning
basics
●
Backpropagation
and
feed
forward
neural
networks
●
Convolutional
networks
(CNNs)
●
Recurrent
networks
(RNNs)
and
Long
short-term
memory
networks
(LSTMs)
●
Attention
mechanism
and
transformers
(BER T)
●
Deep
reinforcement
learning
(RL)
Prerequisite
This
is
an
advanced
deep-learning
course,
so
students
must
be
familiar
with:
●
Elementary
linear
algebra,
e.g.,
matrix
multiplication,
eigenvalue
decomposition,
and
matrix
norms.
●
Elementary
calculus,
e.g.,
convex
function,
differentiation
of
scalar
functions,
first
derivative,
and
second
derivative.
●
Python
programming
(especially
the
Numpy
library)
and
Jupyter
Notebook.
Course
Workload
Expectations
This
course
is
a
fast-paced
and
challenging
course!
We
assume
you
will
allocate
an
average
of
at
least
15-20
hours
per
week
outside
of
lectures
for
study ,
assignment
and
project
work.
It
is
your
responsibility
to
manage
your
workload
such
that
you
have
enough
time
for
this
course.
Please
DO
plan
ahead.
Softwar e
Any
OS
should
be
okay .
You
can
use
either
Tensorflow
or
Pytorch
as
your
framework.
You
are
encouraged
to
set
up
a
computing
environment
in
your
own
computer
if
you
have
an
accessible
GPU.
For
lectures
and
labs,
we
will
rely
on
Google
Colab
,
especially
the
GPU/TPU
to
train
our
deep
learning
models.
Piazza
We
will
use
the
Piazza
(you
can
log
into
this
system
through
Canvas)
for
a
discussion
board
and
for
posting
updates.
Participation
on
the
discussion
board
counts
towards
your
grade.
A
constructive,
relevant,
non-redundant
post
earns
a
Piazza
point.
Here
are
some
examples:●
A
question
that
elicits
a
substantive,
correct
answer .
In
other
words,
this
cannot
be
a
superficial
question
that
you
can
easily
find
answers
on
Google.
This
also
suggests
that
you
should
provide
enough
details
in
this
question.
●
A
substantive,
correct
answer
to
another
student's
question.
●
A
substantive,
correct
refinement
or
clarification
of
another
student's
answer
to
a
question.
●
A
correction
to
anything
substantive
that
I
get
wrong.
Q&A
policies
on
Piazza:
●
Your
questions
posted
on
Piazza
are
usually
answered
within
24
hours,
except
on
weekends
and
holidays.
●
No
anonymous
questions
will
be
answered
by
the
teaching
staff.
If
there
is
an
anonymous
post,
I
will
ask
the
author
to
reveal
the
ID
on
the
platform.
This
is
because
you
are
expected
to
form
a
connection
with
your
classmates.
You
can
also
form
groups
with
the
help
of
Piazza.
●
Debug:
Since
this
is
an
advanced
deep
learning
course,
students
are
expected
to
be
familiar
with
Python
coding
and
know
how
to
debug
by
themselves.
If
you
show
up
saying,
"my
code
is
broken
or
I
can't
get
the
performance
numbers,
help",
this
counts
as
negative
participation
in
the
class
.
We
do
not
expect
the
teaching
staff
to
debug,
or
fix
any
problem,
which
is
simply
not
feasible
and
does
not
help
with
educational
objectives.
The
best
way
to
go
about
getting
help
is
to
isolate
exactly
where
the
problem
is.
We
will
expect
that
you
have
created
new
tests
to
run
that
show
when
the
code
works
and
when
is
the
point
that
the
code
fails
(deterministically).
Part
of
this
is
being
able
to
identify
where
you
think
the
problem
is,
what
have
you
tried,
and
how
isolated
have
you
made
the
problem.
●
Assignment-related
questions
posted
on
Piazza
will
only
receive
responses
from
the
teaching
staff
within
a
24-hour
window
prior
to
the
due
date.
For
example,
if
the
assignment
is
due
at
6:30
pm
and
you
post
a
question
at
10
am
on
the
same
day,
the
teaching
staff
will
answer
your
question
only
after
the
deadline
(i.e.,
after
6:30
pm).
Consequently ,
it
is
advisable
to
plan
ahead
and
refrain
from
depending
on
last-minute
assistance
from
the
teaching
staff.
Assignments
There
are
tentatively
3
assignments
across
this
semester .
Assignments
must
be
submitted
on
Canvas
and
are
date-stamped
when
submitted.
While
you
are
allowed
to
submit
your
assignment
late,
you
will
receive
a
20%
grade
penalty
for
every
additional
day
after
the
deadline.
As
this
is
a
generous
late
submission
policy ,
penalties
are
strictly
enforced,
and
I
will
NOT
grant
extensions.
Please
plan
accordingly ,
and
do
not
leave
submission
for
the
last
minute.
You
are
allowed
to
discuss
the
assignments
with
up
to
three
classmates,
but
each
assignment
must
represent
yourown
effort.
If
you
discussed
assignments
with
any
other
classmates,
please
also
list
their
names
in
your
submission
(e.g.,
“This
assignment
submission
was
discussed
with
xx”).
Plagiarism
Policy
I
have
seen
plagiarism
in
my
past
years
of
experience
teaching
programming
classes,
and
it
seems
that
a
few
people
will
turn
in
assignments
that
are
not
their
own.
You
should
understand
that
it
is
very
easy
to
detect
copy
&
paste
for
programs,
even
when
a
program
has
been
changed
to
cover
where
it
comes
from.
Copying
code
from
others,
or
letting
others
copy
your
code
is
a
violation
of
student
disciplinary
policy
and
academic
integrity
at
USF,
and
the
penalty
for
such
behavior
follows
related
school
policy .
Copying
answers
from
each
other
or
from
prior
students
of
this
class
will
be
viewed
as
“plagiarism”
and
will
earn
you
a
zero
grade
on
that
assignment
for
the
first
offense,
an
F
grade
for
the
class
for
the
second
offense,
and
dismissal
from
the
MS-BAIS
program
for
the
third
offense.
Lab
Sessions
There
are
tentatively
6-8
labs,
which
follow
immediately
after
each
lecture
.
Each
lab
session
lasts
30-45
minutes.
Within
each
lab,
you
need
to
finish
some
given
tasks.
Typical
tasks
are
reviewing/practicing
what
we
learned
in
lectures
for
that
week.
For
some
labs,
you
need
to
submit
your
code.
You
are
requir ed
to
attend
all
the
Lab
sessions
.
Course
project
Please
refer
to
Project_23fall.pdf
to
find
more
details
of
project
requirements.
Attendance
There
might
be
some
random
attendance
checks.
I
will
deduct
10
points
if
you
are
absent
for
all
checks.
Failing
to
attend
midterm
or
final
project
presentations
will
receive
an
“F”
for
the
course
except
for
extreme
reasons.

Acknowledgments
Much
of
the
structure
of
this
course
was
derived
from
previous
courses
taught
by
Professors
Shusen
Wang
and
Theja
Tulabandhula.
I
appreciate
their
help
and

to
build

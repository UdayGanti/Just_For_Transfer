Stephen DiasioAssociate Professor of Instructionsdiasio@usf.eduCampus: St. PetersburgRoom: LPH 314BPhone: 727-873-4296VitaPersonal WebsiteAs a researcher of innovation, Stephen Diasio's contributions include extending the
               open innovation paradigm through his investigation with IBMInnovation Jams. He argues that inflows and outflows of knowledge within open innovation are relevant
               beyond product and service innovation and through the application of emerging technology
               can support managerial decision-making. Research during his PhD studies at ESADE Business
               School culminated in framing his Open Model of Decision-Support research agenda.DownloadNot All That JazzJamband as a metaphor for Organizing New Models of Innovation article.He has worked as a lead researcher on several European projects including the IA5
               Research Project sponsored by the Spanish Ministry of Industry focusing on open innovation-
               a precursor to Europe's Open Cities and the development of a cognitive system with
               the GREC research group on Project SENSUS and chocolatier Oriol Balaguer.Diasio's research touches on the use of metaphors to understand models of innovation.
               He argues the dominant metaphor of a jazz band to understand innovation and creativity
               is outdated and limiting. He suggests new metaphors are needed to understand emerging
               models of innovation and he offers the metaphor of a ‘jamband’ as the new lens to
               view these new modes of innovation. Drawing from the legendary "jambands" such as
               The Grateful Dead, The Allman Brothers Band and even Dave Matthews Band, he forms
               insights into the microfoundations and mechanisms to design these emerging models
               of innovations.Diasio is co-chair of the Innovation SIG and a track chair for the Open Innovation
               track at the European Academy of Management Conference.TeachingENT 3613 Creativity and InnovationENT 4244 Scalability- Corporate InnovationENT 4945 Student Consulting- Design ThinkingInnovation and DaliManagement Design ThinkingImprov for BusinessResearchBalser, W, Diasio, S., and T.

Who can apply for GA/T A positions? Can I apply for GA/T A positions outside the School of
Information Systems & Management (SISM)?
Any full-time student who is registered for at least 9 credit hours can apply for GA/T A positions.
You do not have to restrict your GA/T A search to the SISM department. Many other departments and
centers such as Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR), INT O USF , USF IT , USF
Provost's Of fice, USF Library , etc. provide GA/T A opportunities for technically qualified students.
Since programming skills are often valued for many of these positions, our BAIS students often find
on-campus employment opportunities at many of these departments.
 
What are the job requirements of these positions?
In TA positions, you are typically helping a professor with a certain class (e.g., statistics). So you need
a strong background in that content to qualify for a TA in that class. For example, if Dr . Bhattacherjee
needs a TA for his Statistical Data Modeling class, he will require that you take that class and perform
well in the class to be considered as his TA for that class.
In GA  positions, you are helping a center/lab with research, data collection, or other ef forts. There
may be special skills (e.g., programming) required for these positions that will be listed in the job
announcement.
 
Where can I find GA/T A openings in SISM and in other departments?
Visit USF Careers  (https://gems.usf.edu:4440/psc/gemspro-
tam/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?FOCUS=Applicant) to get a real-
time list of all on-campus job opportunities across USF .  Please do not write to individual professors
asking them for GA/T A positions.
 
Do GA/T A positions come with tuition waiver?  
GA/T A positions may come with tuition waivers for the out-of-state portion of your tuition, meaning
that you will still have to pay the in-state portion of your tuition (approximately one-third of out-of-state
tuition).
 
What is/are the selection criteria for GA/T A positions in SISM?10/14/23, 9:49 PM Graduate/Teaching Assistantships: ORG04655 : MS-BAIS Current Students
https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1794296/pages/graduate-slash-teaching-assistantships?module_item_id=28098681 2/2SISM traditionally has 4 types of GA  positions available:
1. Department undergraduate teaching assistant: Selection based on GRE/GMA T scores,
TOEIC/T OEFL/IEL TS speak scores (international students), strength in the teaching area and
interviews.
2. Department graduate teaching assistant: Selection based on class performance, faculty
recommendation.
3. Department skills based positions: Selection based on project scope and technical skills required.
4. Pre-approved positions outside the department: Selection based on position responsibilities and
technical skills required. 
Incoming international students will have to submit a copy of their visa along with their application in
order to be considered for any positions.  
 
What are the rules and restrictions for GA/T A positions?   
GAs/T As have to be on campus as a full-time student (or can have a reduced course load during
the final semester).
GA/T A positions begin one week before classes start and finish at the end of the semester/ending
contract date. 
GAs/T As are not eligible for full-time internships or practice center projects in the same semester .
If you did a CPT  internship in a previous semester , that job must end before your GA/T A start
date. 
GA/T A positions are semester-wide contracts, and you are not allowed to discontinue the position
for an internship later on in the same semester . Though we understand that internships are more
beneficial for you than the GA  position, once you start the GA  position at the school, discontinuing
it in the middle of the semester af fects the school and professorsâ€™  planning. Thus, no internship for
a GA/T A will be approved once the semester starts . The only exception will be if you have a 20
hours internship and a maximum of one class take in the semester . Your 20 hours GA  + 20 hours
internship are a full-time engagement. You will not have the time to take more than 1 class along
with both 20 hrs GA  and 20 hrs internship.

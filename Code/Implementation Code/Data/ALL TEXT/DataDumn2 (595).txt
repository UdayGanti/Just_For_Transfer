Overview
The Department of Emergency Management, in partnership with key internal and external
               stakeholders, develops and maintains various plans to manage emergencies and disasters
               that may affect the university.
The Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) is the University's guiding document for the management of emergencies and disasters
               affecting USF. It includes hazard specific plans, operational plans, and campus-specific
               annexes.
The University's Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP) provides guidance and instructions for continuing critical campus operations in the
               event of a disruption.
A Building Emergency Action Plan (BEAP) provides response strategies for a variety of emergencies that may occur in buildings
               across campus. Every BEAP is unique to each building.

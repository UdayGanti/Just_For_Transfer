Juniors and seniors who are the first in their families to attend college often need
               help transitioning into a rewarding career. For more than 25 years, the USF Muma College
               of Business Corporate Mentor program has helped students explore career opportunities
               and develop strategies for their professional, academic, and social success.
Mentors provide access to opportunities where students learn about interviewing, corporate
               culture, networking, and how tobecome leaders in the corporate world. Active participants find that the workshops,
               seminars, dinners, and other opportunities help them develop professionally, as well
               as build the underlying skills that allow them to become tomorrow's leaders.
Traditionally, first-generation students incur the largest student loan debt of any
               population, with four out of five students working more than 25 hours weekly to pay
               for their educational expenses. To answer this great financial need, the Corporate
               Mentor Program awards over $80,000 in scholarship to participatingstudents each year.
There are many elements to the Corporate Mentor Program, such as graduation rates,
               students volunteering, and participation in student organizations. Learn more about these initiatives

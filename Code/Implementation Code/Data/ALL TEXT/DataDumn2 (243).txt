What if there was a better way to provide business students with real internships
               and corporate experience while creating a talent pipeline for the Tampa Bay area community?
We’ve made this a reality. Our comprehensive vision for experiential learning makes
               USF one of the first in the nation to focus on real world experience for business
               students.
Companies get highly qualified talent. Graduates get unparalleled opportunities.

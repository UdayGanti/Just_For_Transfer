hybrid course. All course materials will be accessible on Canvas in an asynchronous format. 
However, it is mandatory for us to meet  in person at the Sarasota campus on four specific dates 
during the Fall 2023 semester: 8/31, 9/28, 10/26, and 11/30, from 5:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m.   
• If you need help  learning how to perform various tasks related to this course or other courses 
being offered in Canvas, please view the following videos or consult the Canvas help guides. You 
may also contact USF's IT department at (813) 974 -1222 or help@usf.edu . The course will  include recorded lectures, reading assignments, tests (midterm and Final), quizzes, discussions 
and homework (posted on CANVAS).  
 
COURSE LOGISTICS:  
1. This is an online course but it is mandatory for us to meet in person at the Sarasota campus on 
four specific dates during the Fall 2023 semester: 8/31, 9/28, 10/26, and 11/30, from 5:00 p.m. 
to 7:45 p.m.  
2. Students may form groups of three students each to complete projects.  
3. Use the phrase “ISM4323” in the subject line of your email  (no spaces) to help me filter emails.  
4. In all deliverables and communication, please include the names of ALL students involved. 
This is needed for allocating grades correctly. You will lose credit for not doing so.  
5. Readings and assignment deliverables ar e always scheduled on the Friday of the week.  
6. Deliverables are due by the end of day on the due date (usually this means 11:55pm).  
7. We will try to manage class time so that as much of the hands -on activity is performed in class 
as possible.  
8. Assignments for  each chapter have 5 components – questions, example case, critical thinking, 
hands -on activities and design case. Critical thinking and example case are worth 0.5% each, 
the other activities are worth 1% of the credit for the course. These assignments can  take time, 
please plan your time accordingly.  
9. The design case is your opportunity to conduct industry research. This is your opportunity to 
discover issues, concerns, products and solutions not discussed in class and apply them within a 
coherent framework  to solve customer concerns.  
10. I will do my best to try and teach you something useful, not merely certify what you already 
know. This impacts exam preparation too. For example, you should not expect a shortlist of 
questions to prepare.  
11. Subject to availabili ty of time, select groups will be invited to present their designs in class on 
the last day.  
 
GRADING POLICIES  
•    Makeup Exam Policy : There will be  no make -ups for the midterm, or the final exam. Make up 
opportunities will only be provided for job -related situations and for medical emergencies in the 
immediate family.  
• Late Submission Policy:  All assigned work are expected to be turned in on time, by 11:59 p.m. 
of the due date. Late assignments will not be accepted unless prior permission has been granted 
by your Instructor. It is okay for students to work ahead and complete all assignments, labs and 
tests if they desire, but no makeups or extra credit will be offered.  
• Exam Retention Policy : After exams are graded, the instructor will review the examination with 
the class and collect all exams. The exams will be retained for one semester following the current 
one, and then they will be destroyed.  
 
GRADING SCALE  
USF policy requires that all students receive a graded assignment or examination prior to the semester’s 
drop/withdraw date (please refer to important dates on page 1 of this syllabus). Student performance for 
this course will be evaluated based on tests, assignments, and quizzes, as detailed below. Below is a

STUDENT EXPECTATIONS  
• Attendance Policy : There is no live lecture attendance requirement. Everything  will be placed on 
Canvas.  
• Course Hero/Chegg Policy:  The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may 
not use websites that enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this 
purpose. Thi s does apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – any use of these 
websites (including uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the academic 
integrity policy.  
• End of Semester Student Evaluations:  All classes at USF make use of  an online system for 
students to provide feedback to the University regarding the course. These surveys will be made 
available at the end of the semester, and the University will notify you by email when the 
response window opens. Your participation is expected  and valued.  
• Turnitin.com:  In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system 
which instructors may use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions 
of web sites, as well as an enormous database o f student papers that grows with each submission. 
Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all assignments in both hard copy and electronic 
format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a report from turnitin.com that 
states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment. For a more detailed look at 
this process visit http://www.turnitin.com . Essays are due at turnitin.com the same day as in class.  
• Note to Students:  All students  must review  the syllabus  and the requirements,  including  the 
online  terms  and video  testing  requirements,  to determine  if they wish  to remain  in the course.

to drop or withdraw  from  this course  before  the end of the drop/add  period.   
• Honorlock  for the Exams:  Online  exams  and quizzes  within  this course  will require  online  
proctoring.  Therefore,  students  will be required  to have  a webcam  (USB  or internal)  with a 
microphone  when  taking  an exam  or quiz.  Students  understand  that this remote  recording  device  
is purchased  and controlled  by the student  and that recordings  from  any private  residence  must  be 
done  with the permission  of any person  residing  in the residence.  To avoid  any concerns  in this 
regard,  students  should  select  private  spaces  for the testing.  Students  with concerns  may discuss  
location  of an appropriate  space  for the recordings  with their instructor  or advisor.  Students  must  
ensure  that any recordings  do not invade  any third -party  privacy  rights  and accept  all 
responsibility  and liability  for violations  of any third -party  privacy  concerns.  Student s are strictly  
responsible  for ensuring  that they take all exams  using  a reliable  computer  and high-speed  
internet  connection.  Setup  information  will be provided  prior  to taking  the proctored  exam.  To 
use Honorlock,  students  are required  to download  and install the Honorlock  Google  Chrome  
extension . For additional  information  please  visit the USF  online  proctoring  student

COURSE FAQ  
How to communicate with me? You can either (i) send me an email directly or through Canvas, or (ii) 
call/text me or (iii) set up an appointment to see me in my office. When emailing directly or through 
Canvas, please write the appropriate subject and include  your name at the bottom of the email. The emails 
should be composed professionally and the language should be courteous and respectful.  
  
How NOT to communicate with me?  
1. Please do not email me from a non -USF email account.  
2. Please do not submit deliverables to me through email. All deliverables must be submitted 
through Canvas.  
3. Please do not reply to an email that I send to the entire class without changing the subject line, 
unless your question is about that subject. If you  are using the “Reply” button as a means to get 
my email address in the “To” line, please change the subject line and also delete all previous text 
from that email, if your email pertains to something else.  
 
How will I communicate with you? I will send an nouncements through Canvas. The announcements 
should arrive in your inbox. If you send me an email through Canvas, I will respond back through 
Canvas. If you send me an email directly, I will respond back to your email address. I will make every 
attempt to  reply to your emails within 24 hours during weekdays. I cannot guarantee a response within 24 
hours on weekends. Occasionally emails do tend to go to my Spam  Mail folder so if you have not 
received my response within 24 hours, please either resend your email or call my office phone number 
and leave a message in case I am not in my office. I will provide feedback on your assignments through 
Canvas.  
 
How to Succ eed in this Class?    
• Check Canvas and emails daily for announcements: I will periodically send emails and 
announcements. I encourage you check them daily.  
• Read the syllabus:   It is a lot of trouble  to prepare so detailed a syllabus. You should assume I ha d a 
reason for it. I want to make sure that you understand the course structure and expectations and have 
your questions answered on the first week. This will help us all have a more productive semester. 
Please read  every word  in this syllabus by end of th e first week and ask me any questions.  
• Complete the reading assignments:   You will get a lot more out of this class if you complete the 
assigned readings. In my experience, students who don't complete the reading either never complete it 
or try to cram it  all in just before the exams. That doesn't work. Most of the time, unsatisfactory 
grades are due to procrastination than any other cause. Please give yourself ample time each week to 
complete the assigned readings  for this class.  
• Watch the recorded lectur es/external videos : Some modules will  include recorded lectures and 
LinkedIn Learn videos . The lectures that are prepared by me contain topics that I think are the most 
important in the course. Please watch them.   • Do not procrastinate on completing assignments :  You cannot pass the course without doing at 
least most of the assignments. The homework assignments build upon one another. If you get behind, 
you will find it very difficult to catch up.  
• Complete the quizzes:  Completing the quizze s will prepare you for the exams. So, I encourage you 
to complete them by the due dates.  
• The bottom line “Do not procrastinate. ”

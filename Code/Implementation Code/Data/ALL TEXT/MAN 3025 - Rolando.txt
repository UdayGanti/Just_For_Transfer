1    PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT  MAN 3015 | Fall 2023 | Monday and Wednesday 2:00pm–3:15pm | LPH 123   Instructor Information   Professor: Patrick Rolando   E-Mail: prolando@usf.edu    Phone/Message: Oﬃce 365 ‘USF Teams’   Oﬃce Hours: After class or by appointment          Course Description  People don’t pay for a ﬂight; they pay for a relaxing vacation.  People don’t pay for fancy cars; they pay for status.  People don’t pay for ﬁtness coaching; they pay for conﬁdence. Sell the desired outcome and they’ll pay for your solution.   The course provides a basis for developing the skills necessary to eﬀectively ﬁnd your solution through management, planning, organizing, inﬂuencing, and controlling.  You also need to have self-knowledge of your strengths and weakness, so this course will assist you to develop or elaborate on those, how to set goals aligned with your mission and value as a one-person business or manager for an organization and develop on those.  Once the solution is determined, clients hire based on your social media, customers buy based on your social media, employers hire based on your social media, creators hire based on your social media, brands hire based on your social media, and in this course, we will dive into the basics of social media for modern life.  We will also review issues of management such as ethics, diversity, and social responsibility, and how it ties to your mission and values as a part of your solution.  This instructor believe that the future should have no poverty with people focused on doing what they like and assisting others along the way, which this course will get you knowledge on how to be part of that group.   The class material will include both theory and practical applications. In addition to lectures covering the topics discussed in your book, you will be expected to complete activities through McGraw Hill Connect, engage in class discussions/class exercises and to complete an individual project that will encompass the creation of diﬀerent social media for various purposes with the intent to get you prepared for the workforce.    For an additional resource, this course will also use Teams. We will have a Teams chat room. This will be a place for us to interact with one another, ask general questions, and post general announcements. If you do not ﬁnd your MAN3015 team in your Microsoft Teams, please let me know. It will go live on August 21, 2023. For easier access and faster responses download the Teams app and have notiﬁcations turned on. 2    Student Learning Outcomes   1.

Grades will be determined using the grading scale shown below.     F  ≥ 100  D  100 – 199   C  200 – 299   B  300 – 399   A  400 – 500  5      Policies  Communication  The best way to contact me is through email. I answer non-time sensitive emails within 24/48 hours on weekdays. I may respond to it less frequently on weekends and holidays; There may be times during the semester when I do not have access to email. I will be sure to notify you if such situations occur.    To avoid confusion on my part, please follow the following guidelines when sending emails:  1. Use only this email address: prolando@usf.edu   2. Identify yourself as a student in MAN 3015 in either the subject line or the ﬁrst paragraph of your email.  3. Always sign your emails, so that I know who sent them.  4. Treat your emails as professional communications––use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling, and avoid internet shorthand.  I will hold myself to the same standards I expect of you. Emails that I receive that do not adhere to the guidelines above will not be answered.    Technology in the Classroom  Regarding computers and tablets, feel free to use them in class for taking notes. Keep in mind, though, that the research on this topic shows that taking notes by hand helps you to retain information better than taking notes on a computer (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014). Regarding cell phones, all I ask is that you exercise good judgment. If you need to send a text message, feel free to do so quickly and quietly. Similarly, if you need to make or take a phone call, please just step out of the classroom.    General Attendance  Students can have one excused absence WITH prior notice. Students who have more than one absence will lose 2 percentage points for each additional class missed beyond that.  These include excused and unexcused absences. If a student is absent for 3 or more times, the teacher and student will meet to discuss the possible options including withdrawal from the course.  A student is not considered to have attended class unless they are present for most the class (>60%).   Presentation Day Attendance:  It is important to be respectful towards your classmates’ eﬀorts.  Therefore, one additional percentage point (3 percentage points per class) will be deducted for each unexcused absence or tardiness on any of the presentation days. To be excused, an excuse must be a valid reason and given PRIOR to the presentation.     Late Submissions  Canva submissions will be penalized by 2% for the ﬁrst 24 hours that they are late. An additional 5% will be deducted to the submission grade every 24 hours thereafter. Late submissions will not be accepted for Connect assignments.   6    Academic Integrity  The Academic integrity means honesty and responsibility in scholarship. Here are the basic assumptions about academic work: (1) Students attend university in order to learn and grow, (2) academic assignments exist for the sake of this goal, (3) grades exist to show how fully the goal is attained, (4) thus, all work and all grades should result from the student's own eﬀort to learn and grow. Academic work completed any other way is pointless, and grades obtained any other way are fraudulent.  Academic integrity means understanding and respecting these basic truths, without which no university can exist. Academic misconduct -- "cheating" -- is not just "against the rules"; it violates the assumptions at the heart of all learning. It destroys the mutual trust and respect that should exist between student and professor. Finally, it is unfair to students who earn their grades honestly.  Academic dishonesty is a completely unacceptable mode of conduct and persons involved in academic dishonesty will be disciplined in accordance with university regulations and procedures. Discipline may include suspension or expulsion from the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating (e.g., looking on another person's exam or allowing them to look on yours), plagiarism, collusion, the submission for credit of any work or materials that are attributable in whole or in part to another person (i.e., copying someone else's work, allowing someone to do your papers or take your exams for you), taking an examination for another person, any act designed to give unfair advantage to a student or the attempt to commit such acts.     Students with Disabilities  Students in need of academic accommodations for a disability may consult with Students with Disabilities Services (SDS) to arrange appropriate accommodations. Students are required to give reasonable notice prior to requesting an accommodation. A letter from SDS must accompany this request. Student responsibilities: http://www.sds.usf.edu    University Policy on Religious Observances  No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief.  In accordance with the University policy on observance of religious holy days, students are expected to notify their instructors if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination prior to the scheduled meeting.    Honorlock  All students must review the syllabus and the requirements, including the online terms and video testing requirements, to determine if they wish to remain in the course. Enrollment in the course is an agreement to abide by and accept all terms. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period.  Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the residence.  To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University library and other academic sites at the University oﬀer secure private settings for recordings and students with concerns may discuss location of an appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor.  Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third-party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third-party privacy concerns.  7    Students are strictly responsible for ensuring that they take all exams using a reliable computer and highspeed internet connection. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. To use Honorlock students are required to download and install the Honorlock Google Chrome extension (Links to an external site.)." For additional information please visit the USF online proctoring student FAQ (Links to an external site.) and Honorlock student resources (Links to an external site.).     Turnitin.com  In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which instructors may use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all assignments in both hard copy and electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment. For a more detailed look at this process visit http://www.turnitin.com.   Campus Free Expression  It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you ﬁnd uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even oﬀensive.  In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research. Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.    Course Calendar on the next page.

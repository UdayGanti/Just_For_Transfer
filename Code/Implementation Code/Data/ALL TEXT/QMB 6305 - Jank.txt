University Course Description:  A study of the general concepts of interval estimation, hypothesis
testing, correlation and multiple regression with an emphasis on applications, concepts and interpretation
of results. See also usfweb.usf.edu/academic-programs/details/prefix/QMB/code/6305
Course Pre-reqs:  NA
Course Purpose: The practice of business is changing. Due to increasing desktop computing power
and companies amassing massive amounts of data, business decisions made by companies are
becoming more and more data based. This holds in many sectors, but in particular in banking,
insurance, investment, retailing, eCommerce and direct marketing. Because of this new approach to
business, companies are in need of people with a new set of computational skills. There is also an
increasing notion that in order to stay competitive, managers need to be re-equipped with long-lost
analytical skills. Related success stories include companies such as Google, Amazon, Netflix, AT&T,
Harrah’ s, Capital One or the Boston Red Sox. And the reason that these few companies are so
successful is that they have access to a pool of people with special analytical skills and tools, tools that
are related to the exploration and analysis of business data.
 
Student Learning Outcomes:  In this course, you will learn basic analytical principles that can guide a
manager in making complex decisions.  A good decision uses sound reasoning and takes into account
all of the relevant data that is available at the time the decision is to be made.  In order to arrive at a
good decision, a manager must be able to:
Identify an underlying analytical structure  in a seemingly complex and amorphous decision problem
Understand the trade-offs  involved in the decision7/21/23, 2:17 PM Syllabus for QMB6305.030F23.81776 Managerial Decision Analysis
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1827668/assignments/syllabus 2/13Understand the role of uncertainty  and risk in the decision-making process
Analyze available data to understand relationships  among variables and to create predictions
Use available computing technology  to arrive at optimal solutions.
 
Starting from basic principles, you will learn about data exploration and visualization, methods for data &
decision modeling, and risk analysis. The course is very hands-on, and emphasis is placed on
understanding when to use which method. This course will also allow you to better interact with
personnel specializing in analytics. In addition, you will learn how to implement data-driven decision
making using one of the most powerful software packages.
 
INSTRUCT OR:
Wolfgang Jank is the Anderson Professor of Global Management in the Department of Information
Systems and Decision Sciences, College of Business Administration, at the University of South Florida.
Before joining USF , Professor Jank was an Associate Professor in the Department of Decisions,
Operations & Information Technologies and the Director of the Center for Complexity in Business at the
Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. He is interested in applying ideas from
statistics and data mining to problems in electronic commerce, marketing, and operations management.
Dr. Jank has authored over seventy refereed articles and three books, and presented his work at
national and international meetings. Dr . Jank received his Master ’s degree from the Technical University
of Aachen (Germany) and his PhD in Statistics from the University of Florida. He has been involved in a
variety of consulting projects and he is on the advisory board of several private companies. Prof. Jank is
teaching classes in data analytics in dif ferent programs. While at the University of Maryland, he has
received numerous awards including the top 15% teaching award for teaching MBA  core classes.
 
Required T exts/Reading Materials: We will use two dif ferent books for this course. The books will be
used simultaneously in that one book covers strategic aspects of business analytics from a high-level
point of view; the other book has more of an operational flavor in that it conveys hands-on ideas for data-
modeling. The two books are
Business Analytics for Managers  by Jank, Springer , 201 1 (ISBN 978-1-4614-0405-7).

(“clickers”). Clickers allow me to receive feedback from the entire class instantly; they also allow you to
gauge your own progress relative to your peers. Background stories on clickers can be found e.g. here

DATA MINING SOFTW ARE
We will use the software R for analyzing and mining our data. R is free! In fact, R is an open-source
based software and as such grows much faster than any commercial software solution. R is one of the
most powerful and popular software solutions for mining business data. In fact, large analytical
companies such as Google or AT&T use R. R is also becoming more and more popular among
government agencies (such as the DOD). R is powerful,  yet it is free – this combination makes it a
winning proposition for many companies, especially during times of tightening budgets and financial
stress.

COURSE WEBSITE
I will use the course website (hosted by 'Canvas’) to distribute various files as necessary (e.g., course
documents, data, assignments and solutions). Please be sure to visit Canvas on a regular basis.
COURSE FORMAT
Class meetings include lectures, discussions, team presentations and in-class projects.  Each class
meeting requires extensive reading  to be completed before class.  Please refer to the schedule at the
end of this syllabus for the reading assigned for each class.
The lesson plan for each class is designed to complement  and leverage  the assigned readings, not
merely replicate the ideas contained in the readings.  You will find the pace of the class to be
uncomfortably rushed if you have not completed the reading assigned for that class.
 
Completion of assigned readings will be checked in two ways. One is via class discussion ; the other is
via specifically designed test questions, administered via the “Clickers” (see also earlier topic), and to be
answered by the entire class. Performance on both will af fect your participation grade .
 7/21/23, 2:17 PM Syllabus for QMB6305.030F23.81776 Managerial Decision Analysis
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1827668/assignments/syllabus 4/13We will discuss both hands-on implementation  of data-driven ideas as well as more high-level,
strategic concepts  of data analytics. Strategic discussions of data analytics will be led by student
teams  using chapters from the text “Competing on Analytics.” In every meeting, a dif ferent chapter will
be discussed. To that end, I will post questions pertaining to each chapter . For every meeting, one or two
student teams will prepare a short presentation based on these questions and discuss their answers and
solutions in class.
 
At the end of some class meetings, we will conduct in-class projects . In-class projects serve the
purpose for you to immediately practice the theoretical concepts learned in class. It will also give you an
opportunity to get clarification and instant feed-back from the instructor and the class. Since class time is
valuable, time for these projects will be limited. It is thus essential that you show up prepared. Projects
will be posted before class and you are expected to have downloaded instructions & data and you are
also expected to have attempted to solve the problem(s). In other words, you are expected to already
have a good sense of the problem before the start of the project  so you can hit the ground running.
 
Grade Categories and W eights: Your final numerical score for the semester will be determined by
various deliverables according to the following system of weights:

ATTENDANCE & CLASS P ARTICIP ATION
Effective participation consists of not only responding to questions raised by the instructor but also
asking thoughtful questions and responding to contributions from your fellow-students.
 
Quality of participation is more important than quantity .  However , you will not earn credit in this
component, if you rarely speak in class.  Quality of participation includes:
Evidence of reading and prior analysis; Relevance of comments; Ability to listen and relate to input from
other students; Ability to lead discussion into previously unexplored areas; Ability to admit error; Ability to
intellectually interact with other students (and not just the instructor).7/21/23, 2:17 PM Syllabus for QMB6305.030F23.81776 Managerial Decision Analysis
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1827668/assignments/syllabus 6/13 
Attendance and participation will be captured in part by the interactive polling system . Special emphasis
will be placed on participation during the in-class projects .
 
WEEKL Y TEAM PRESENT ATIONS
Every week, a dif ferent team (or set of teams) will take the lead discussing select chapters from the text
“Competing on Analytics.” Please refer to the detailed weekly schedule at the end of this syllabus. The
team(s) will prepare a short presentation (based on a set of questions that I will distribute) and present
their answers and solutions in class. While the presentation is primarily lead by one team of students, the
remaining class is also encouraged to share additional/alternate views.
 
INDIVIDUAL  ASSIGNMENTS
Several times throughout the course, an individual assignment will be due. The primary purpose of these
assignments is for students to have the opportunity to practice the concepts learned in class, and to
implement them using real data and real software. Individual assignments are expected to be solved
rather quickly and not to consume much of your time. Careful participation during the in-class projects
will allow you to solve the individual assignments more ef ficiently .
 
TEAM ASSIGNMENT : TEAM P APER & TEAM PRESENT ATION  
The team assignment consists of two components: a team paper  and a team presentation  (to be held
during our last in-class meeting).
The team paper consists of a comprehensive exercise in which you will use all of the methods &
concepts learned in class and apply them to a decision making situation. In particular , your task will be to
identify a data-driven decision scenario, collect appropriate data, analyze the data and derive actionable
insights from your analyses. The data-driven decision scenario should relate to a real-world problem at
your workplace and you should collect real data to address (and propose solutions) to the problem. Your
final deliverable should contain answers to the following questions
What is the nature of the business problem that you are addressing? Why is the problem important?
Why is it dif ficult (i.e. why has it not been addressed before)?
How did you identify a suitable data-source for your problem? Why is the data relevant for your
problem? W ould other data-sources have been possible? Which ones?
How did you collect and capture the data? How did you assure that the collected data achieves the
necessary data-quality? W ere there any challenges with collecting the data?7/21/23, 2:17 PM Syllabus for QMB6305.030F23.81776 Managerial Decision Analysis
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1827668/assignments/syllabus 7/13How did you explore the data? What tools did you use to discover patterns and trends in your data?
What insights did you find? How did these insights af fect your data collection ef forts? How did they
affect your modeling ef forts?
How did you go about modeling your data? What are the main research hypotheses that you wanted
to address with your model? Did your model confirm these hypotheses? Or did it suggest alternate
findings?
How did you use your model and data explorations to derive actionable insights? What business
insight can you derive from your analysis? Did you share these insights with managers/clients at your
workplace? How did they react to it?
The deliverable for this assignment is a team paper (10 page limit) and a team presentation.
Presentations will be held during the last class meeting. The paper is due at the same time.
It is anticipated that this is the most time-consuming assignment so you are urged to start early . You
should, as a team, start as soon as possible to lay out a project plan and assign project components to
individual team members.
The order for the team presentations will be determined randomly .
All team members are expected to be present during the presentations.

GENERAL  ATTENDANCE POLICY
USF General Attendance Policy  (http://ugs.usf.edu/policy/GeneralAttendance.pdf)
Students are expected to attend classes. Faculty must inform students of attendance requirements on
syllabi. Instructors should accommodate excused absences by making arrangements with students
ahead of time (when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work.
DISABILITY  ACCESS
USF System Policy 0-108  (http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-0-
108.pdf)
Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Students with Disabilities Services (SDS) in
order to receive academic accommodations.
SDS encounters similar dif ficulties with course syllabi each semester . Highlighted here are some issues
to consider as faculty members develop syllabi:
Accommodated Quizzes, T ests and Exams
SDS administers more than 7,000 exams to the USF community each academic year . The student is
responsible for scheduling accommodated tests and exams with SDS. Students must schedule with SDS
at least one full week before the requested test date. Students who miss this deadline complete a Late
Exam Request Form requiring an instructor signature. SDS schedules late exam requests as space
allows and as close to the original test date as possible.
Due to the volume of tests and exams SDS manages, SDS cannot provide accommodated testing space
for "pop" or unscheduled quizzes. Consult with SDS for information on accommodating unscheduled
quizzes.
Make-up Exams
Students who are taking a make-up exam due to disability reasons (medical issues, scheduling conflicts
with other courses and extended exam time, disability related appointments etc.) should be allowed to7/21/23, 2:17 PM Syllabus for QMB6305.030F23.81776 Managerial Decision Analysis
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1827668/assignments/syllabus 11/13take a make-up exam within 10 business days of the student's return to classes. SDS schedules make-
up exams as space allows.
Online Proctoring such as Proctorio
Consult with SDS prior to a student who utilizes accommodations using Proctorio. Some SDS students
have atypical testing behaviors. Other SDS students utilize adaptive software that does not collaborate
well with Proctorio software.
Laptop or Electronic Device Usage
If prohibiting laptop, phone or electronic device usage in class, keep in mind that some SDS students
utilize such devices for note taking and recording. Still others have medical applications on cell phones
that the student cannot turn of f (blood sugar monitors, medication alerts etc.) Policies that indicate, "Only
those with accommodations may use such devices" inadvertently draw attention to the student with the
accommodation. SDS suggests using language that indicates, "Students utilizing laptops, cell phones or
other electronic devices for non-academic reasons during class time may be penalized . . . ."
Clicker Accessibility
Consult with SDS about alternatives to clicker points. Many SDS students have disabilities that af fect the
ability to answer clicker questions.
Attendance/Participation Accommodations Apply to all courses – Even on-line
If a student has attendance or participation accommodations, SDS provides an "Attendance/Participation
Accommodation Form" as part of the student's accommodation letter . This form is tool intended to guide
a conversation between a student and instructor about missed courses, missed deadlines and the
procedures to follow when requesting extensions. The accommodation does not allow a student to miss
an indefinite number of classes or deadlines. Instructors may always consult with SDS to determine what
is reasonable.
Accessible Materials
USF policy requires that all course materials be accessible to students. Per the USF Caption and Media
Access Policy , all media sources must be captioned prior to use. SDS encourages faculty to consider
document accessibility . Use the "Style" functions in Microsoft W ord and the OCR functions in Adobe to
ensure that all course documents are accessible to those who utilize screen reading technology . See the
SDS Accessibility Guide for more information: www .sds.usf.edu (under resources).

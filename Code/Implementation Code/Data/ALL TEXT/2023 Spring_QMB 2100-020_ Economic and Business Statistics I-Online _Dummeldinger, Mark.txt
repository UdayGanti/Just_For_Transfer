Class Recording  
Classes will be recorded and st reamed online. Student’s voice and video will be included in the class 
recording. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure the privacy of their surroundings and 
background is maintained.  
Online Proctoring  
Quizzes and examinations may be conducted us ing online proctoring tools. Keeping the audio and 
video (microphone and camera) on during such exams and quizzes is a must. If the student is not 
willing to use these, the student is asked not to register for this course. Any student may elect to drop 
or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period. Online exams and quizzes within 
this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam 
(USB or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or qui z. Students understand that this 
remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any 
private residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the residence. To avoid 
any concerns in this regar d, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University 
library and other academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for recordings, and 
students with concerns may discuss the location of an appropriate space for the re cordings with their 
instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third -party privacy 
rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party privacy concerns. 
Setup information will be provi ded prior to taking the proctored exam. For additional information 
about online proctoring you can visit the online proctoring student FAQ

 GENERAL ATTENDANC E POLICY:  USF General Attendance Policy  Links  to an external  
site.: Students are expected to attend classes. Faculty must inform students of attendance 
requirements on syllabi. Instructors should accommodate excused absences by making arrangements 
with students ahead of time (when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up 
missed work.  
ADDITIONAL ACCESSIBILITY ACCOMODATION POLICIES   Accommodated Qui zzes, Tests  and Exams:  SAS administers more than 7,000 exams to the USF 
community each academic year. The student is responsible for scheduling accommodated tests and 
exams with SAS. Students must schedule with SAS at least one full week before the request ed test 
date. Students who miss this deadline complete a Late Exam Request Form requiring an instructor 
signature. SAS schedules late exam requests as space allows and as close to the original test date as 
possible.  
Due to the volume of tests and exams SAS  manages, SAS cannot provide accommodated testing 
space for "pop" or unscheduled quizzes. Consult with SAS for information on accommodating 
unscheduled quizzes.  
 Make -up Exams:  Students who are taking a make -up exam due to disability reasons (medical issue s, 
scheduling conflicts with other courses and extended exam time, disability related appointments etc.) 
should be allowed to take a make -up exam within 10 business days of the student's return to classes. 
SAS schedules make -up exams as space allows.  
 Onli ne Proctoring such as Proctorio:  Consult with SAS prior to a student who utilizes 
accommodations using Proctorio. Some SAS students have atypical testing behaviors. Other SAS 
students utilize adaptive software that does not collaborate well with Proctorio software.  
 Laptop or Electronic Device Usage:  If prohibiting laptop, phone or electronic device usage in class, 
keep in mind that some SAS students utilize such devices for note taking and recording. Still others 
have medical applications on cell phones th at the student cannot turn off (blood sugar monitors, 
medication alerts etc.) Policies that indicate, "Only those with accommodations may use such devices" 
inadvertently draw attention to the student with the accommodation. SAS suggests using language 
that indicates, "Students utilizing laptops, cell phones or other electronic devices for non -academic 
reasons during class time may be penalized . . . ."  
Clicker Accessibility:  Consult with SAS about alternatives to clicker points. Many SAS students have 
disabilities that affect the ability to answer clicker questions.  
Attendance/Participation Accommodations Apply to all courses – Even on -line:  If a student has 
attendance or participation accommodations, SAS provides an "Attendance/Participation 
Accommodat ion Form" as part of the student's accommodation letter. This form is tool intended to 
guide a conversation between a student and instructor about missed courses, missed deadlines and 
the procedures to follow when requesting extensions. The accommodation d oes not allow a student 
to miss an indefinite number of classes or deadlines. Instructors may always consult with SAS to 
determine what is reasonable.  
Accessible Materials:  USF policy requires that all course materials be accessible to students. Per the 
USF Caption and Media Access Policy, all media sources must be captioned prior to use. SAS 
encourages faculty to consider document accessibility. Use the "Style" functions in Microsoft Word 
and the OCR functions in Adobe to ensure that all course documents a re accessible to those who 
utilize screen reading technology. See the SAS Accessibility Guide for more 
information:  www.sas.usf.edu   Links  to an external  site.(under resources).

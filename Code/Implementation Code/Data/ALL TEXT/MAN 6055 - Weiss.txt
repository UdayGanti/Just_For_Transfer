Assignment Details
Any general questions should be posted in the FAQs section of the discussion board!

Each assignment is described in detail on the canvas modules page. Please see the module the project is due for the information, except for the Leadership Book Presentation. Since it is the largest project, it is introduced in Module 1. START WORKING ON THE LEADERSHIP BOOK PRESENTATION ASAP! It is due the last week, but you will not want to delay starting it. 

Any writing assignment for this course should be in APA format, especially regarding the citation of sources. This is a graduate level course, and the expectation is that any writing is at that level. If you are not familiar with APA formatting or have questions regarding your writing, please post in the FAQs section of the course, email Dr. Weiss & our TA, or consult the USF Writing Center (this is a great FREE service!!).

If a source is not cited, that is considered plagiarism and will be treated as such. 

Discussion posts will consist of the body of your post and references (no need for the hanging indentation in Canvas, but please follow APA in general when citing). Any papers submitted will need a cover page, the body of the paper, and a references page. A table of contents and abstract is not necessary. 

Instructor Feedback Policy & Grade Dissemination 
You should expect to see a grade for discussion posts and other assignments within two weeks of the submission. Grades are generally posted within a few days to a week, but please allow up to two weeks. Any quizzes in Canvas are graded automatically, and those grades should post immediately or within minutes. Extra credit points will be updated, generally, within 24 hours of completing the requirements of the assignment.  

Course Schedule.
* Note: The Schedule is subject to revision at the instructor’s discretion 

USF Core Syllabus Policies
USF has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, religious observances, academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual harassment that apply to all courses at USF. Be sure to review these online: usf.edu/provost/faculty-success/resources-policies-forms/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspx   

Course Policies: Grades 

Late Work Policy: 
You should be able to work within the deadlines but understand that unexpected things may come up in your life. This is an asynchronous course that allows you to work ahead and plan your schedule accordingly; you may submit assignments up to two weeks ahead in this course. If you are unable to make a deadline, please inform your instructor by email BEFORE THE DEADLINE ssweiss@usf.edu & ctiamson@usf.edu. Late work will not be accepted without being prearranged with Dr. Weiss.  



Medical Issues: 
Students should not attend events or classes if they are ill, particularly if they have fever and/or gastrointestinal symptoms and/or respiratory symptoms such as a sneezing, runny nose, sore throat or coughing.  Students experiencing any of these symptoms should contact immediately the Student Health Services (813-974-2331) on the Sarasota-Mantatee and Tampa campus or the Wellness Center (727-873-4422). 

Extra Credit Policy: 
Information on Extra Credit in this course is available in Canvas. DO NOT ASK FOR ADDITIONAL POINTS BEYOND WHAT IS POSTED. 

Grades of "Incomplete": 
The current university policy concerning incomplete grades will be followed in this course.
For graduate courses: An Incomplete grade ("I") is exceptional and granted at the instructor’s discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the "I" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate courses from the original date grades were due for that course. An "I" grade not cleared within the two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate courses (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. 

Attendance Policy: 
Attendance will not be taken in this course, EXCEPT for the first week. You are required to complete the syllabus quiz to record your attendance and affirm that you do intend to take this course. 

Campus Free Expression: 
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive. 

In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research. 

Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.

Make-up Exams Policy:
There are not make-up tests or quizzes. 

Rewrite Policy: 
Rewrites are not offered in this course. 

Course Policies: Technology and Media

Canvas: This course will be offered via USF's learning management system (LMS), Canvas. If you need help learning how to perform various tasks related to this course or other courses being offered in Canvas, please view the following videos or consult the Canvas help guides.

Course Policies: Student Expectations 

Health and Wellness: 
Your health is a priority at the University of South Florida. We encourage members of our community to look out for each another and to reach out for help if someone is in need. If you or someone you know is in distress, please make a referral at www.usf.edu/sos so that the Student Outreach & Support can contact and provide helpful resources to the student in distress. A 24-hour licensed mental healthcare professional, offered through the counseling center, is available by phone at 813-974-2831, option 3. Please remember that asking for help is a sign of strength. In case of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.

Title IX Policy: 
Title IX provides federal protections for discrimination based on sex, which includes discrimination based on pregnancy, sexual harassment, and interpersonal violence. In an effort to provide support and equal access, USF has designated all faculty (TA, Adjunct, etc.) as Responsible Employees, who are required to report any disclosures of sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship violence or stalking. The Title IX Office makes every effort, when safe to do so, to reach out and provide resources and accommodations, and to discuss possible options for resolution.  Anyone wishing to make a Title IX report or seeking accommodations may do so online, in person, via phone, or email to the Title IX Office. For information about Title IX or for a full list of resources please visit: https://www.usf.edu/title-ix/gethelp/resources.aspx. If you are unsure what to do, please contact Victim Advocacy – a confidential resource that can review all your options – at 813-974-5756 or va@admin.usf.edu.

Course Hero / Chegg Policy: 
The USF Policy on Academic Integrity specifies that students may not use websites that enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This does apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – almost any use of these websites (including uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy. 


End of Semester Student Evaluations: 
All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide feedback to the University regarding the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of the semester, and the University will notify you by email when the response window opens. Your participation is highly encouraged and valued. 

Turnitin.com: 
In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which instructors may use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all assignments in both hard copy and electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment. For a more detailed look at this process visit http://www.turnitin.com. Essays are due at turnitin.com the same day as in class. 

Netiquette Guidelines
1.	Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers with respect, the same way you would do in a face-to-face environment. Respect other people’s ideas and be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not agree with.  
2.	Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. There will be people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and religious beliefs or other general differences.  
3.	Proofread and check spelling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, and it is more difficult to read. Follow APA formatting/style of writing.  
4.	Keep your communications focused and stay on topic. Complete your ideas before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to easily get your idea or answers they are looking for. Be clear with your message.

Course Policy on Acceptable Use of Generative AI Tools
Course Policy on Acceptable Use of Generative AI Tools Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to foster a dynamic learning environment that encourages technological adaptation, innovative thinking, and the ethical use of AI resources in academic endeavors. 
Policy: 
1. Definition of Generative AI Tools: Generative AI tools refer to any artificial intelligence-powered software, program or application that can generate content, including but not limited to text, visuals, music, and other creative outputs. Examples of these tools include AI text generators, AI content rewriters, AI graphic generators, etc. 
2. Permitted Use: The use of generative AI tools is permitted for course-related submissions, including assignments, projects, presentations, examinations, and other forms of assessment. However, students must responsibly use these tools, adhering to the guidelines outlined in this policy. 
3. Student Responsibility: Students are responsible for appropriately using generative AI tools in their work. This includes: 1. Citing all AI-generated content used in their submissions. 2. Demonstrating a deep understanding of the subject matter, not solely relying on AI-generated content. Cross-reference claims and statements with original sources and providing appropriate cita�ons are expected. 3. Using AI tools as a supplemental resource (i.e., as an editor), not as the primary means of completing assignments. [Here you can clearly articulate how you expect students to use generative AI tools] 4. Understanding that generative AI tools, while powerful, are not infallible and can produce misinformation or inaccurate results. Students are responsible for the accuracy of their submissions and must cross-verify the information produced by these tools with reliable sources. 4. Violation Consequences: Misuse of AI tools, including use of AI that undermines the student learning objectives of the course or assignment, failing to cite AI-generated content, relying too heavily on AI for work completion [Note: this requires establishing expectations on levels of use with your students], or submitting inaccurate information generated by AI tools, will be subject to academic penalties. Consequences may range from a reduction in an individual assignment grade to larger academic sanctions per USF policy, depending on the severity of the violation (USF Regula�on 3.027). 5. Exceptions: If there are specific assignments where the use of AI tools is not appropriate, these will be clearly marked in the assignment guidelines. Students must adhere to these specific instructions. 6. Questions and Clarifications: If students are unsure whether a tool they wish to use qualifies as a generative AI tool, or if they have questions regarding the allowable use of such tools, they should consult with the course instructor before using it.

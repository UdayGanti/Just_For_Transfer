COURSE DESCRIPTION: This is a Core course for all Business Majors.
Catalog Description of the course: Simple linear regression and correlation, multiple regression and model building, forecasting models, analysis of variance, chi-square tests, nonparametric methods.
Purpose of the course: QMB 3200 is the second course in Statistics. It builds upon the foundation established in your first course in Statistics (QMB 2100 or its equivalent). The purpose of QMB 3200 is to prepare students to appreciate the role statistics plays in business analytics and decision making. In particular, the course emphasizes and prepares students to “learn”, “interpret”, and “be ready to apply” the concepts and methods, rather than learn calculations alone.
 

COURSE OBJECTIVES:  Through this course, students would develop a working knowledge and expertise on how to apply statistical methods on business problems. In particular, students will be able to:
Strengthen fundamentals, formulate hypothesis from the problem statement, and learn to perform analyses,
Interpret statistical results generated from a selected software program and communicate the findings in simple terms to the decision-maker.
Identify opportunities for and learn to apply statistical tests on Categorical data such as contingency analysis and goodness of fit tests
Explain the basis and apply Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) techniques on data from experiments/observational studies in business
Identify application opportunities and learn to perform simple linear and multiple regression analyses, extract valuable information, and apply the results for predictions and improved business decision-making.
 
COURSE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES:  At the conclusion of the course students should be able to:
Develop hypothesis from a problem statement, choose an appropriate statistical technique to apply given the problem context, perform the analysis; and most importantly, interpret the reports/results, and develop well-reasoned and evidence-based conclusions
Learn to perform hypotheses tests on categorical data using Chi-Square goodness of fit tests and tests of independence
Understand the principles of designed experimentation, identify an appropriate experimental design to perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on data from experimental/observational studies; develop hypothesis statements, perform the analysis, understand, and interpret ANOVA output from a select software; and develop conclusions
Develop both simple and multiple regression models from given data, understand and interpret regression analysis output from a select software package, test hypotheses and infer relationships between variables, and make predictions on response.
 
COURSE POLICY
1.  Exams:  There will be two graded opportunities given during the semester.  The dates of these opportunities are given below. The exams will be given live in class. They will be open book/open note exams. 
2.  Computer Projects:  Four computer projects will be assigned during the semester. You will be required to perform statistical analyses on real data using the computer (Statistix software).  You will be given (electronically) project assignments in Canvas and you will submit the project online by the due dates shown below. Projects can be turned in thru email late, but will incur a 20% penalty for each day it is received late.
3.  Online Competency Assessments: Four online assessment checks will be provided throughout the semester to make sure you are staying current with the material being presented in class. These assessments will be done within Canvas and will allow two attempts. Due dates for these assessments are shown below. Answers to the assessments will be given after the due date shown, so no late assessments are allowed.
Grading:  The point distribution will be as follows:
Assessment 1: Due 5/24 , 20 points - online
Project 1: Due 5/24, 40 points - online
Assessment 2: Due 5/28 , 30 points - online
Project 2: Due 5/29, 60 points - online
Exam 1: In Class 5/31 , 50 points 
Assessment 3: Due 6/11, 20 points - online
Project 3: Due 6/11, 40 points - online
Assessment 4: Due 6/18 , 30 points - online
Project 4: Due 6/18, 60 points - online
Exam 2: In Class 6/21, 50 points 
Grades will be based on the following grading scale:
            96.50 - 100%               A+
            91.50 – 96.49%           A
            89.50 – 91.49%           A-
            86.50 – 89.49%           B+

            59.50 – 61.49%           D-
                   0 – 59.49%           F
If you are close to the next higher grade at the end of the semester, I will look at your final exam to determine if I should bump your grade up.

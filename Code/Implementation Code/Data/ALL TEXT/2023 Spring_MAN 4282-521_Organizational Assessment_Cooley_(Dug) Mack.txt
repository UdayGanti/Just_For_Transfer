Class  Notes:  Class notes or  tapes of  class  lectures  may not be  sold.  
 
Team Case:  The class will be divided into teams.  Each team is responsible for  
completing  the case assigned  in class.  Since  the case requires  knowledge of  the content  
of the course to complete it correctly, the case will not be assigned until around the time  
of the second test.  This is not a long case and you should have plenty of time to finish it.  
Since this is a group project, all members of a group will rece ive the same group score for  
the project.  
 
Disabled Students:  Any student with a disability is encouraged to meet with me  
privately during the first week of class to discuss accommodations. Each student must  
bring a current Memorandum of Accommodations from the Office of Student  
Disability Services which is prerequisite for receiving accommodations.  Accommodated  
examinations  through  the Office  of Student  Disability Services  require  two weeks  notice.  
All course documents are a vailable in alternate format if requested in the student’s  
Memorandum  of Accommodations . 
 
Grade Changes: Any student that would like to appeal the grade they received for a test  
or project should see me immediately.  Don’t wait until the end of the semester if you feel  
your grade is wrong.  If you wish to appeal your final class grade, you must contact me  
within  one month of the  start of  the following semester.  
 
Plagiarism:  Plagiarism  will not be tolerated.  Students caught  plagiarizing  other peoples  
work will be dealt with according to the official University policy.  All materials taken  
from  electronic sources  must be properly referenced.

normal operations.  During this time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction

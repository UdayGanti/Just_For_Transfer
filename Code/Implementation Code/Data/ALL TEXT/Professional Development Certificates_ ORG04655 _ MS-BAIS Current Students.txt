To help our students in their ef forts to acquire professionally marketable knowledge and skills, the
department has developed a certification exam support program that refunds the costs of relevant
certification exams for students in the department's degree programs. This fund is made possible by
the generous support of our local industry partners. Exam support is on a first-come-first-serve basis
while funds last.  The fund is managed by Anna Bahvala.

View tips for study abroad

While USF offers numerous excellent programs that are open to all USF students, the
               Muma College of Business offers separate programs exclusively for business majors
               where students can earn business credit hours that apply toward their majors. Costs
               and accommodations vary by location, itinerary, and coursework offerings. Aid is available
               for some all study abroad programs.

SEMESTER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS
Full semester exchange programs allow students to fully immerse themselves in the
               culture of their host nation and attend classes at partner institutes, colleges, or
               universities with other foreign students as well as those local to the region. These
               longer trips allow students to truly get to know the people and culture while experiencing
               day-to-day life in another country.
SUMMER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS
Summer study abroad programs are designed to provide an intense academic experience
               while immersing students in the culture of their host country. Led by Muma College
               of Business faculty, these programs are a great way for students to earn USF credit
               hours that apply toward business degree programs as well as USF's summer academic
               requirements.
INTERNATIONAL INTERNSHIPS
Several international internships are available to students, programs sponsored by
               external organizations. As a resource to help students find international internships,
               several of the more popular internships are listed, but students are responsible for
               exploring, vetting, and handling arrangements for such programs.

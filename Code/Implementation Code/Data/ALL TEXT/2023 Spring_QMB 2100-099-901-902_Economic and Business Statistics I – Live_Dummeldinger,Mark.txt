Covid -19 Procedures  
All students must comply with university policies and posted signs regarding COVID -19 mitigation

Failure to do so may result in dismissal from class, referral to the Office of Student Conduct and Ethical 
Development, and possible removal from campus.

Class Recording  
As of the beginning of t he semester, no recorded lectures will be made. Should USF alter the way the 
class is to be presented, online recordings will be made available to students. Student’s voice and video 
may be included in these class recording. It is the student’s responsibil ity to make sure the privacy of their 
surroundings and background is maintained.  
Online Proctoring  
Quizzes and examinations may be conducted using online proctoring tools. Keeping the audio and video 
(microphone and camera) on during such exams and quizzes  is required. If the student is not willing to use 
these, the student is asked not to register for this course. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from 
this course before the end of the drop/add period. Online exams and quizzes within this course ma y 
require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a 
microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is 
purchased and controlled by the student and that re cordings from any private residence must be done 
with the permission of any person residing in the residence. To avoid any concerns in this regard, students 
should select private spaces for the testing. The University library and other academic sites at th e 
University offer secure private settings for recordings, and students with concerns may discuss the 
location of an appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure 
that any recordings do not invade any third -party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability 
for violations of any third -party privacy concerns. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the 
proctored exam. For additional information about online proctoring you can visit the on line proctoring 
student FAQ at  http://www.usf.edu/innovative -education/resources/student -services/online -

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
Catalog Description of the course:  
Data description; exploratory data analysis; introduction to probability; binomial and normal distributions; 
sampling distributions; estimation with confidence intervals; tests of hypotheses; control charts for quality 
improvement.  
Purpose of the course:  
The purpose of the course is to prepare students to appreciate the role statistics plays in data analysis and 
decision making in various business environments. Being the first course, it focuses on Descriptive 
Statistics, Inferential Statistics, and Quality Control. In particular, this course covers descrip tive statistics 
and then introduces the concepts and methods of probability, probability distributions, sampling 
distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, inference, and control charts for quality improvement.

inferential techniques and be able to apply these concepts to real data to use sample 
information to m ake inferences about populations of interest.  
2.   The students will be able to differentiate between the two types of statistical techniques and 
be able to apply each when appropriate.   
3.   The student will understand the difference between ethical data analys is and using data to 
distort or mislead.   
4.   The student will be able to summarize data graphically and perform data analysis to compute 
measures of central tendency as well as dispersion.

  COURSE POLICIES  
1. Weekly Competency Checks:  On select weeks, I will post online competency checks to ensure

being of our students. Please be aware that educators must report incidents of sexual harassment and 
gender -based  crimes including sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence that come to 
their attention. I am required to report such incidents in order for the Office of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities or the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Eq ual Opportunity can investigate the incident or 
situation as a possible violation of the USF Sexual Misconduct/Sexual Harassment Policy and provide 
assistance to the student making the disclosure. If you disclose in class or to me personally, I must report

  GENERAL ATTENDANCE POLICY:  USF General Attendance Policy  Links  to an external  site.: Students 
are expected to attend classes. Faculty must inform students of attendance requirements on syllabi. 
Instructors should accommodate excused absences by making arrangements with students ahead of time 
(when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work.  
ADDITIONAL ACCESSIBILITY ACCOMODATION POLICIES  
  
Accommodated Quizzes, Tests  and Exams:  SAS administers more than 7,000 exams to the USF 
community each academic year. The student is responsible for scheduling accommodated tests and exams 
with SAS. Students must schedule with SAS at least one full week before the requested test date. 
Students who miss this deadline complete a Late Exam Request Form requiring an instructor signature. 
SAS schedules late exam requests as space allows and as close to the original test date as possible.  
Due to the volume of tests and exams SAS manages, SAS cannot provide accommodated testing space for 
"pop" or unscheduled quizzes. Consult with SAS for information on acc ommodating unscheduled quizzes.  
  
Make -up Exams:  Students who are taking a make -up exam due to disability reasons (medical issues, 
scheduling conflicts with other courses and extended exam time, disability related appointments etc.) 
should be allowed to take a make -up exam within 10 business days of the student's return to classes. SAS 
schedules make -up exams as space allows.  
  
Online Proctoring such as Proctorio:  Consult with SAS prior to a student who utilizes accommodations 
using Proctorio. Some SAS students have atypical testing behaviors. Other SAS students utilize adaptive 
software that does not collaborate well with Proctorio software.  
  
Laptop or Electronic Device Usage:  If prohibiting laptop, phone, or electronic device usage in class, keep 
in mind that some SAS students utilize such devices for note taking and recording. Still others have 
medical applications on cell phones that the student cannot turn off (blood sugar monitors, medication 
alerts etc.) Policies that indicate, "Only thos e with accommodations may use such devices" inadvertently 
draw attention to the student with the accommodation. SAS suggests using language that indicates, 
"Students utilizing laptops, cell phones or other electronic devices for non -academic reasons during  class 
time may be penalized . . . ."  
  
Clicker Accessibility:  Consult with SAS about alternatives to clicker points. Many SAS students have 
disabilities that affect the ability to answer clicker questions.  
  
Attendance/Participation Accommodations Apply t o all courses – Even on -line:  If a student has 
attendance or participation accommodations, SAS provides an "Attendance/Participation Accommodation 
Form" as part of the student's accommodation letter. This form is tool intended to guide a conversation 
betwe en a student and instructor about missed courses, missed deadlines and the procedures to follow 
when requesting extensions. The accommodation does not allow a student to miss an indefinite number 
of classes or deadlines. Instructors may always consult with  SAS to determine what is reasonable.  
  Accessible Materials:  USF policy requires that all course materials be accessible to students. Per the USF 
Caption and Media Access Policy, all media sources must be captioned prior to use. SAS encourages 
faculty to consider document accessibility. Use the "Style" functions in Microsoft Word and the OCR 
functions in Adobe to ensure that all course documents are accessible to those who utilize screen reading 
technology. See the SAS Accessibility Guide for more informat ion: www.sas.usf.edu   Links  to an external  
site.(under resources).

I. Welcome!  
You are enrolled in the four -week version of CGS 2100 which means you must hit the deck 
running .  This means registering  for Biz Café and MindTap our simulation software and 
have  a desktop version of Office 365 installed, which  is a free download from USF.   You 
will have fun running and integrating Office 365 applications into your café.  After each 
week of operations  your café is ranked against twenty -four other cafés.  It is up to you to 
stay on top or determine what adjustments you must make to be competitive . 
 
If you put effort into your café you will find yourself eagerly awaiting your weekly results.  
Since we only have four weeks to run the business simulation your nine decision periods 
(weeks) will take place over two weeks with decision periods advancing Sunday through 
Thursday.  
 
II. University Course Descr iption  
A study of the use and impact of computers in all areas of business organizations. Course 
includes hands -on experience and the use of software packages for business analysis.  
 
III. Course Prerequisites  
None.  
 
 
 
2 IV. Course Purpose   
 
Computers in Business (CGS 2100) is part of the University of South Florida's General 
Education Curriculum. It is certified for Information and Data Literacy. Students enrolled 
in this course will be asked to participate in the USF General Education assessment 
effort. This will involve submitting copies of writing assignments for review via Canvas.  
 
The two General Education assignments that are part of the USF General 
Education assessment are the #GEA1 -Biz Café Report and #GEA2- Biz Café 
Excel Capstone.  
In this course,  you develop  computer  proficiency  in the use of business 
productivity  software  using  Microsoft  Office  365 and running  a small business.  
This course  prepares  you to use Microsoft  Office  for coursework  assigned  in 
most  USF courses  and to attain valuable  entry  level  workforce  skills.  Excel  and 
Word are desired skill  sets for employment  in a myriad  of occupations.  You 
are introduced  to the basic  skills required  for entry  level  positions  and then  
asked  to use them  in making  business  decisions  for a small  business.  
 
There  is a mix of assignments  that ensure  you demonstrate  you have  learned  the 
necessary  skills  using  Microsoft  Office,  interpret data  and identify  changes  needed  to 
run a profitable  café . The course  divided  into to two sections:  Microsoft  Office  
essentials  and the business  simulation.  
 
 
V. Course Format  
 
The approach this course applies to the applications for Microsoft Office  and running  is 
that you learn by doing; the best way to get familiar with Microsoft Office is to use it.   The 
best way to understand what is involved in running a small business is to be hands on.  
 
There is an emphasis  on Excel.  As you work  through your  Word assignments  you are  
introduced  to Biz Café, a business  simulation  application,  where  you make  business  
decisions,  submit  reports,  and compare sales  and survey  data.  During  this process  you will 
demonstrate  a competency  with  Microsoft  Office  and how to  use the applications  to help  
you create  reports  and analyze  information  related to  your  café.  
When managing your Café in the Biz Ca fé business  simulation  program , you  make  
weekly  decisions  in several  areas.  Your decisions  are evaluated  by an algorithm that  
compares  your  input  with  the other  student  run cafés  and calculates  your  results  for 
the week.  You receive  reports  on your  sales,  inventory  and customer  satisfaction  to 
name  a few and information  on many  aspects  of the competing  cafés.  You must  
evaluate  what went  right  or wrong,  analyze  your  coffee  shop  against  the competition  
 
3 and create  an action  plan  for the next  decision.  The Biz Café  competition phase  has 
your café competing directly with the cafés in your industry (group of cafés).   
The start -up decision  is important,  and you will have  to make  weekly  special  decisions  
which will include  expanding  your  menu,  adding  entertainment,  opening  on weekends  
and make  social  and ethical  choices.  You will integrate  your  income  statement,  
customer  satisfaction  and other  metrics  to determine  how  you manage  your  decisions.  
Reviewing  the Biz Café  manual  and simulation  case  is essential  to running  a successful  
café in this simulation.  
 
You are introduced  to Office 365 applications  through MindTap modules.  The training  
assignments  are step -by-step  tasks  that take  you through a project.  The assigned  
module  projects  cover  the same  skills,  but you are graded  on the completed  project.  
The skills  training  for each  module maps  to the module  learning  objectives  which  are 
tied to your  Student  Learning  Outcomes.  You are assessed  on your  completion  
percentage  for each  training  module  and module  grader  projects  as assigned.  
 
Once  you registered and have viewed the orientation videos for MindTap you complete  
the training  for each  assigned module  which  prepare s you for the Biz Café  and MindTap  
Projects.  You earn  points  when you complete  training  and assigned  projects.  Feedback  
is immediate  and within  the training  you have  help  in the form of a short  intro  
explaining  the task,  you can observe  the task completion  by viewing  a recording or you 
can walk  through  the task with  the aid of the simulation  in the practice  mode.  
 
After reviewing the student manual, you have  access to Biz Café in the p ractice  mode  
where  you operate  in separate  but identical environments  using  benchmark  competition.  
This exercise provides  you a terrific opportunity  to gain experience  making  decisions  and 
using  the tools  and resources  available  in the simulation.  The course then transition s into 
the competitive  phase  of the course. The  four primary  areas  of responsibility  are 
management,  operations,  marketing , and special  decisions.  You determine pricing,  hours,  
staffing,  how  much coffee  to purchase  and more  as you compete  against  other  cafés  in 
the course.

IX. How to Succeed in this Course  
 MindTap  (SAM)  training  and projects  take  time  to complete.  This means  that you need  
to devote  time  each  week  on the assignments  if you want  to stay on track  and not end 
up taking  short  cuts as due dates  approach.   
 
Biz Café  is a business simulation  application  where you run a coffee  shop.  Preparing  for 
each  decision  also requires effort to run a competitive Café . 
 
There  are a wide  range  of skill sets in our class.  Those  that have  never  used  Microsoft  
Office  will need more  time  to complete  MindTap  tasks.  You have  unlimited  attempts  
in the training  and you can submit  SAM projects  three  times  and I use the highest score.  
 
I estimate  that you need  to commit  12-15 hours  a week  to stay on track.  
 
I suggest  you keep  track  of the effort  you need  to complete  the first few assignments  
and make  the necessary  adjustments  to your  prep  time  and create  a work  schedule  that 
fits in with  your  other obligations.  
 
Students that stay on top of the assignments  do well in the course .

XV. Class Policies and Procedures  
  
 
13 USF Core Syllabus Policies: USF has a set of central policies related to student recording class 
sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic 
disruption, religious observances, academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual harassment that apply to all courses at USF. Be sure to review these online at:
 
https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx    
 Disruption to Academic Progress : Disruptive students  in the academic setting hinder the 
educational process. Disruption of the academic process (USF Regulation 3.025) is defined as 
the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation  of the instructor: (a) directs attention away from the 
academic matters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the health, safety, or well-being of self or other persons.    Religious Observances: All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate their religious observances, practices, and beliefs (USF Policy 10-045). The Univ ersity of South Florida, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required 
classes and examinations in view of customarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or communities comprising USF’s constituency. Students are expe cted to attend classes 
and take examinations as determined by the university. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. However, students should review the course requirements and meeting days and times to avoid foreseeable conflicts, as excessive absences in each term may prevent a student from completing the academic requirements of a specific course. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in accordance with this Policy.  
Academic Continuity: In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to 
suspend normal operations. During this time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that include, but are not limited to: Learning Management System, online conferencing, email messaging, and/or an alternate schedule. It is the 
responsibility of the student to monitor the Learning M anagement System for each class 
for course -specific communication, and the main USF, College, and Department 
websites, emails, and MoBull messages for important general information  (USF Po licy 
6-010). For additional guidance on emergency protective actions and hazards that affect 
the University, please visit  www.usf.edu/em . 
 
Attendance:  There are no scheduled class meetings in the online section.  You do have 
to complete the First Day Attendance Survey to meet USF’s fir st day attendance policy.  
 
Special Accommodations : Students  in need  of academic  accommodations  for a disability  may 
consult  with  the Office of  Students  with  Disabilities  Services  to arrange  appropriate 
accommodations.  Students  are required  to give reasonable  notice  prior  to requesting  an  
 
14 accommodation.  I will collaborate  with  you to ensure  you have  access  to all course  materials  
and have  adequate  time  to complete  assignments.  
 
Student Academic  Grievance  Procedures:  The purpose  of these  procedures  is to provide  all 
undergraduate  and graduate  students  taking  courses  within  the University  of South Florida 
System  an opportunity  for objective  review  of facts  and events  pertinent  to the cause  of the 
academic  grievance.  An “academic  grievance”  is a claim that a specific academic  decision  or 
action  that affects  that student’s  academic  record  or status  has violated  published  policies  
and procedures  or has been  applied  to the grievant  in a manner  different  from  that used  for 
other  students.  
 
Sexual  Misconduct/Sexual  Harassment  Reporting:  USF is committed  to providing  an 
environment  free from  sex discrimination,  including  sexual  harassment  and sexual  violence  
(USF System  Policy  0-004).  The USF Center  for Victim Advoc acy and Violence  Prevention  is a 
confidential  resource  where  you can talk about  incidents  of sexual  harassment  and gender - 
based  crimes  including  sexual  assault,  stalking,  and domestic/relationship  violence.  This 
confidential  resource  can help  you without having  to report  your  situation  to either  the 
Office  of Student Rights  and Responsibilities  (OSSR)  or the Office  of Diversity,  Inclusion,  and 
Equal  Opportunity  (DIEO),  unless  you request that they  make  a report.  Please  be aware  that 
in compliance  with  Title  IX and under  the USF System  Policy,  educators  must  report  
incidents  of sexual  harassment  and gender -based  crimes  including  sexual  assault,  stalking,  
and domestic/relationship  violence.  If you disclose  any of these situations  in class,  in papers,  
or to me personally,  I am required  to report  it to OSSR  or DIEO  for investigation.  Contact  the

Campus Free Expression: It is fundamental to the University of South Florida ’s mission to 
support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly 
exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable,  disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and 
not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by critica l peer review and rigorous debate, and that the 
idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide 
that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be 
asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas.   
 
Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.  
  
 
15 Classroom  Conduct:  Students  should  behave  professionally  when communicating  with

Incomplete  Grades:  A grade  of “I” (incomplete)  is in place  for unforeseeable  emergencies  
that occur  near  the end of the semester.  A grade  of “I” will be issued  only  in extreme  
circumstances and  then  only  with  complete  written  documentation.  
 
Due Dates and Late Work : Due dates  for assignments  are found  in Canvas , Biz Caf é, and 
MindTap.  It is important  that you complete all assignments.  Your  final  grade  is based  on the 
points  you earn  from  the assignments;  a zero does  not help  your  score at all. 
 
• I use the highest  score  for assignments  that allow  multiple  submissions.  
• MindTap  and Canvas  assignments  submitted  after  the due date  are accepted  up to 
the end of the course with a 20% penalty  applied  to the score.

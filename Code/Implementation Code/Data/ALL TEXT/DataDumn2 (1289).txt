Digital marketing is really a misnomer – there is no marketing today that is not digital.
               Whether you are trying to understand the new customer experience, deliver unique value
               to customers, or measure and report out your impact, employing technologies in novel
               ways is likely at the core of your competitive advantage. Staying up to date on these
               disruptive technologies is always a challenge — until now.

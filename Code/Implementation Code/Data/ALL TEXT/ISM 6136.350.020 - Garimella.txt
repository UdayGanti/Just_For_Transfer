Course Description and Objectives  
The past few years have seen an unprecedented explosion in the amount of data collected by 
businesse s and have witnessed enabling technologies such as database systems, visualization 
tools and statistical and machine learning algorithms reach industrial strength. These trends have 
spawned a new breed of business analytics systems that go significantly be yond reporting 
capabilities, to support predictive modeling and the extraction of business insights from data. 
These trends have also created a new role of “data scientists” who are professionals with 
expertise in the concepts and tools necessary for the s killed use of these systems. Understanding 
the power and limitations of these technologies can provide business managers and information 
systems professionals new approaches to support the task of solving hard business problems 
using data -driven approaches . This course will provide an understanding of fundamental data 
science concepts, techniques and business applications.  
General Learning Outcomes  
• Demonstrate understanding of specific data mining methods  
• Describe different ways in which models can be evaluated  
• Use data mining tools to build descriptive and predictive models  
• Analyze a dataset using data analytics methods  • Describe global business scenarios where data and data mining can be applied

Extra Credit and Make Up Work  
There is no extra credit or make up work available. Q uizzes or exams will not be re -opened in 
case of issues with your computer. It is your responsibility to keep your computer and wifi in full 
working order. Widespread network failures will be dealt with on a case -by-case basis and in 
accordance with Univer sity guidelines.  
Online Exam Proctoring Policy and Notification  
All students must review the syllabus and the requirements, including the online terms and video 
testing requirements, to determine if they wish to remain in the course. Enrollment in the cour se 
is an agreement to abide by and accept all terms. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw 
from this course before the end of the drop/add period.  Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students 
will be re quired to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or 
quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the 
student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with the p ermission of any 
person residing in the residence.  
To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The 
University library and other academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for 
recordings and students with concerns may discuss location of a n appropriate space for the 
recordings with their instructor or advisor.  
Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third -party privacy rights and accept 
all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party privacy concerns.  
Students are strictly responsible for ensuring that they take all exams using a reliable computer 
and high -speed internet connection. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the 
proctored exam.  To use Honorlock students are required to download a nd install the  Honorlock 
Google Chrome exten sion (Links to an external site.) ." For additional information please visit 
the USF online proctoring student FAQ  (Links to an external site.)  and Honorlock student 
resources  
Policy Statements  
https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx . 
Course Policy on Acceptable Use of Generative AI Tools  
Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to foster a dynamic learning environment that encourages 
technological adaptation, innovative thinking, and the ethical use of AI resources in academic 
endeavors.  
Policy:  
1. Definition of Generative AI Tools: Generative AI tools refer to any artificial intelligence -powered 
software, program or application that can generate content, including but not limited to text, 
visuals, music, and other creative outputs. Examples of these tools include AI text generators, AI 
content rewriters, AI graphic generators, etc.  
2. Permitted Use: The use of generative AI tools is permitted for learning and presentations, but not 
for the individual lab work in projects (use in writing industry overviews is permitted), lab work in 
assignments, qui zzes, and exams. For permitted use, students must responsibly use these tools, 
adhering to the guidelines outlined in this policy.  
3. Student Responsibility: Students are responsible for appropriately using generative AI tools in 
their work. This includes:   
o Citing all AI -generated content used in their submissions.  o Demonstrating a deep understanding of the subject matter, not solely relying on AI -
generated content. Cross -reference claims and statements with original sources and 
providing appropriate citations are expected.  
o Using AI tools as a supplemental resource (i.e., as an editor), not as the primary means of 
completing assignments.  
o Understanding that generative AI tools, while powerful, are not infallible and can 
produce misinformation or inaccurate result s. Students are responsible for the accuracy 
of their submissions and must cross -verify the information produced by these tools with 
reliable sources.  
4. Violation Consequences: Misuse of AI tools, including use of AI that undermines the student 
learning obje ctives of the course or assignment, failing to cite AI -generated content, relying too 
heavily on AI for work completion, or submitting inaccurate information generated by AI tools, 
will be subject to academic penalties. Consequences may range from a reducti on in an individual 
assignment grade to larger academic sanctions per USF policy, depending on the severity of the 
violation (USF Regulation 3.027).  
5. Exceptions: If there are specific assignments where the use of AI tools is not appropriate, these 
will be clearly marked in the assignment guidelines. Students must adhere to these specific 
instructions.  
6. Questions and Clarifications: If students are unsure whether a tool they wish to use qualifies as a 
generative AI tool, or if they have questions regarding th e allowable use of such tools, they 
should consult with the course instructor before using it.

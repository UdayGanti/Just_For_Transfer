GJ de Vreede serves as the interim dean for the Muma College of Business and a professor
               in the School of Information Systems and Management. He has taught undergraduate,
               graduate, doctoral and executive courses in areas such as agile software development,
               systems analysis and design, teamwork/facilitation and research methods.
His research focuses on AI, crowdsourcing, and collaboration engineering. His work
               has been cited over 10,000 times and appeared in journals such as the Journal of Management Information Systems, the Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Management Information Systems Quarterly Executive, Information & Management, Small Group Research, and the Communications of the ACM. Throughout his career, he has received more than $6.5 million in funding as (co)-principal
               investigator from federal, state, industry, military and private sources. His h-factor
               (51) places him in the all-time top-100 in his discipline. A Stanford University study
               identified him as a top 2% researcher worldwide across all fields of study, based
               on his career-long citation impact up until the end of 2020. In 2011, he received
               the GDN Section Award from the INFORMS Group Decision & Negotiation Section for accomplishments
               and contributions both to the research area of group decision and negotiation as well
               as to the INFORMS GDN section.
He received both a PhD and a MS in Information Systems from Delft University of Technology
               in the Netherlands.

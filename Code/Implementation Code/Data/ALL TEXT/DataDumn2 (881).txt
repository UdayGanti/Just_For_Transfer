How Much Will It Cost to Attend USF?
The Cost of Attendance charts provide estimated expenses for a full time student based
               on residency and living arrangements. The amounts are used in awarding financial aid
               funds. As these are estimates, please note that if you enroll less than full time,
               the amounts will be reduced to reflect lower costs.

Net Price Calculator
This calculator is intended to provide estimated net price information (defined as
               estimated cost of attendance including tuition and required fees, books and supplies,
               room and board (meals), and other related expenses minus estimated grant and scholarship
               aid) to current and prospective students and their families based on what similar
               students paid in a previous year.

University Course Description  (Verbatim from USF’s course inventory ): A course in research strategies, 
design, analysis, and measurement for business research.   
(Source: http://ugs.usf.edu/course -inventory/ ). 
 
Course Prerequisites ( Verbatim from the catalog): None  
(Source: https://academicplanning.usf.edu/course -inventory/?output=detail&subj=QMB&num=7565 ) 
 
COURSE OBJECTIVE  
The purpose of this course is to introduce doctoral students to the philosophy of science and methods for 
conducting business research.  Many business dis ciplines follow social science research paradigms that include 
surveys, case / qualitative studies, experiments, and the analysis of secondary data.  This course is appropriate for 
all doctoral students who want to develop a basic understanding of these fundamental business research 
techniques and when it is appropriate to use them.  Given ti me constraints, we will only be able to provide an 
introduction and overview of each topic . Students will need to take other courses to appropriately use one or 
more of these approaches in their own research. Upon completing the course the student should be able to make 
an informed choice of the most appropriate methodology to explore a given research question.  
 
After taking this course, students should be able to:   
 Describe current academic discourse and empirical research in selected domains to critically evaluate 
theoretical arguments, use or critique these arguments in their research, and evaluate the links between 
theoretical arguments and empirical methods  
 Expl ore and develop research ideas to internalize what they learn through readings and discussions and 
to make progress towards publishing the most promising ideas   
 
 
COURSE MATERIALS  
I have selected some readings to give you an exposure to research methods and related discourse that 
applies to business disciplines . Most of the required readings should be available through the course website or 
library, you should try to locate them and contact for any readings or other working papers tha t you are unable to 
locate after you have exhausted your efforts. I strongly recommend that you subscribe to a newspaper like Wall 
Street Journal (or Financial Times) and a magazine like “The Economist” to stay on top of current events in 
business and society to inform your work.  
                                                 
1 The syllabus is tentative and subject to change. Any changes will be announced in class and/or documented via 
Canvas/email. We will discuss any changes t o schedule if there are any scheduling conflicts that the instructor may run into 
over the semester. Some sessions may be conducted using Teams.  Syll_QMB7565_IntroRM_F23_20Aug2023v2skm         2 of 16

Required Book  
• None, any required materials can be read by borrowing from USF  librar y, or via elib rary.  
 
Recommended Book s 
 
• Singleton, R.A., and Straits, B.C., Approaches to social research ( Sixth  Edition), Oxford University 
Press, New York, 2018. (We will draw quite a lot on this book and it is a good idea for you to own a 
copy of a book like this for your  reference)  [A pdf version of the 6th edition is available for about $30 at 
this website: https://ebookplan.com/product/ebook -pdf-approa ches- to-social -research -6th-edition -by-
royce -a-singleton/  ] 
• Shadish, W. R., Cook, T. D., and Campbell, D. T. 2002. Experimental and Quasi -Experimental Designs 
for Generalized Causal Inference Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning  (This is another good 
book to have and read for any serious student)  
 
 
COURSE STRUCTURE  
The class will be highly interactive and discussion- oriented. It is required that all participants complete 
all required read ings prior  to coming to class. A bsent a l egitimate reason, failure to do the readings will result in 
the participant being excused from the class meeting and docked one letter grade each time.  To achieve our goal, 
it is not sufficient to simply read the articles but t o think about them and make s ense of them critically , often this 
requires readin g the articles several times.  
As part of the course, students will develop a research proposal examining a topic that is potentially 
important, interesting and relevant to their own discipline. Students will present their research ideas and 
proposed methods for studying them several times during the course, and will receive feedback from other 
students as well as the instructo r. The course is as much about “consuming” the content covered in the course, as 
much it is about “producing” new knowledge leveraging that consumption.  
 
 
GRADING  
The final grade will be based on instructor’s evaluation of your performance on summary of papers assigned 
to you, your performance as a paper/ session discussant, class par ticipation, and term paper. Late assignments are 
not accepted.   
 
 30% : Session summaries and class participation  
While all students are expected to read all papers and contribute to discussion in each class, each 
student will lead the discussion for his or her assigned papers.  In the lead role, the student in 
charge of a particular paper will prepare a 2 page summar y of the assigned paper(s) to class.  In 
general, such a summary should provide a brief overview of the research questions, theoretical 
underpinning , hypotheses, what authors found, contributions, relationship of the paper with other 
papers and findings, a nd potential extensions (or future research that can overcome the limitations 
of that paper).  Talk about both positives and negatives of the paper and offer your conjectures on 
why the paper was published, why it should not have been published, and/ or wha t may make this 
paper publishable  or unpublishable  (if it is a working paper). I certainly want to see a section on 
some “doable” future research projects that will extend or improve what this paper was trying to 
do. Just a summary and “copy and paste” of paper’s tables and figures is not acceptable-- we are 
looking for your critique and critical value added comments . Students will post a soft copy of the 
summary on course website before the session and bring hard copies of their summary for 
everyone to the class (if there is a face- to-face class) .   
 Syll_QMB7565_IntroRM_F23_20Aug2023v2skm         3 of 16 
 3 You are expected to have a healthy skepticism in critiquing a paper , progress in science depends 
on “dissatisfaction” with current and received wisdom. I also encourage you to be “constructive” 
and always have a remedial and reasonable suggestion accompanying your critique that will make 
a paper better or how future research can overcome the limitations of the paper that you will be 
discussing.  Being positive does not, however, mean that we will shy away from di scussing what 
may be considered as flaws in theoretical justifications, empirical aspects or writing. But 
whenever you point to those, tell us how you would have approached those issues given the same 
research question and the data to which authors had acc ess.  
 
Beyond leading the discussion of the paper assigned to you, each of you should identify the 
unifying themes of that week’s readings to develop a mental map of the “state of the art” in that 
area to identify potential dis sertation topics that will significantly advance that stream of work.  
 
• 70% : Term Paper  
Develop an original research proposal or paper (not more than 20 pages double spaced , 
professionally formatted with Tables, Figures and References) on any phenomenon of  your liking  
in your discipline or a related business discipline . Your paper must address the following issues:  
 
1. What is the research question? Why is it important and interesting? How will an answer 
to this question change how we think about that issue t heoretically or how we may like 
to manage that particular issue in a better way than we otherwise would? Discuss y our 
contributions, and research and managerial relevance very briefly. [Introduction]  
2. How has this or related phenomenon been studied in the prior literature? What new 
theories you are developing or what extensions are you proposing? What is your research 
model and how do your hypotheses make new theoretical or empirical contributions? 
[Literature Review, Research Model]  
3. How will you test your  hypotheses  using state -of-the-art methods ? [Research Method or 
Design]  
4. What results do you expect to find or have found? [Results]  
5. What are your main findings? What are the key contributions? What are the research and 
managerial implications arising out  of your new findings ? What are the limitations of 
your proposed study? How will you extend your research further? [Discussion, 
Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research]  
 
Please be prepared to report your progress every week in class, and incorpora te the feedback from 
instructor and classmates to continuously improve your work. The incremental progress of your 
work over the semester will be taken into consideration for grading purposes. Papers with initial 
and rough data and preliminary results will  be graded more favorably than those that just make 
promises for future data collection/analyses.  
 
Grading scale:  A+: Over 97%, A: 94- 97%, A -: 90-93%, B+: 87 -89%, B: 84- 86%, B -: 80-83%, 
C+: 77 -79%, C: 74- 76%, C -: 70-73%, D+: 67- 69%, D: 6 4-66%, D -: 60-63%,  F: Below 60%  
 
Students typically earn B letter grades for good performance and for meeting all expectations; the A grades 
are for extraordinarily excellent performance when students exceed expectations. The final letter grades 
will be based on the distribution of course points at the end of the semester and instructor’s overall 
assessment of your performance relative to your classmates.

Session -wise Meeting Plan  
We will only discuss the readings marked with an asterisk in this course, other papers are listed for your 
contextual awareness and convenience and we may discuss them brie fly if time permits. If you have read any of 
the assigned papers (those with asterisk) in some other seminar then let me know promptly and depending on the 
composition of the class and in what context you may have read that paper, I will decide whether to still discuss 
that paper or some other paper (feel free to suggest a better substitute). I may add/delete/modify some readings 
as the course progresses, or change the sequence of sessions as I get a better sense of your interests and needs . I 
encourage you to share and point to other readings that you think add to this course or reinforce or provide an 
alternative perspective.

Here are some policies documen ted in the syllabus as suggested or required by USF.   
 
Class Policies:  
 
Communication : Please check course website frequently for updated postings and course related 
communications.  If you have any appropriate and course -related question, first check syllabus or course website 
to ensure that you are not asking something that is already ment ioned in the syllabus or website. If you are not 
able to find answer to your question, then post your question under Discussions at Canvas 
(Canvas>Discussions>"General Questions")  so that TA and/or I can answer your question appropriately via 
that channel or in the next class meeting. If you need to send me an email then please mention your cell phone 
number in the message of your email so that I can call you if necessary  (if the question pertains to your group 
work, please copy all your teammates so that I  can reply to all ). 
 
Class Attendance and Etiquette:  I do not take formal attendance in class  but I do keep track of who is coming to 
class and who is not. Skipping classes means that you will miss valuable content that we cover in class and you 
will do poorly in the exams. Also, please do not disrupt the class by coming to class late or leaving early , arrive 
5 minutes early rather than 5 minutes late. If you skip classes or engage in disruptive side conversations, don’t 
expect much sympathy from me at the end of the semester.  
 
Cell Phones:  While in class, turn your cell phones, iPods etc to silent mode, and step out of the class if you must 
take or make an important phone call. See USF’s official policy on class disruption at 
http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/DisruptionOfAcademicProcess.pdf .  
 
Free Riders in Teamwork (if applicable) : Team members who do not come to team meetings or contribute 
satisfactorily to their assigned team work in a timely manner will receive at least one letter grade lower than the 
rest of their team. There will be no make -ups for free riders.  
 
Your Suggestions : Administration will request you to provide comments regarding various aspects of the course 
toward the conclusion of the course, but those comments come too late to make any mid -course corrections. 
Hence, please discuss with me any ideas that can potentially improve your learning experience during the 
semester. Because the instructor also has responsibi lity for learning experience of the entire class and to ensure 
that course objectives are met while maintaining rigor, it may not be feasible to accept all suggestions. Even if 
your suggestions are not accepted, they can still help us to design other cours es or activities in future so feel free 
to suggest from your side. 
 
Please understand that this syllabus constitutes a CONTRACT  between you and me.  By registering for this 
class, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions as stated in this contract.  Th ese terms will be strictly 
enforced, without exceptions.  If you find these terms unreasonable, you can drop the class and take it in a 
different semester with a different professor.  
 
 Syll_QMB7565_IntroRM_F23_20Aug2023v2skm         14 of 16 
 14 Other Policies Required or Suggested by USF for All Courses2 
Academic Integrity : Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida System’s 
commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its university community. Academic integrity is 
grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, res pect, and fairness. Broadly defined, 
academic honesty is the completion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as 
representative of one’s own efforts. The final decision on an academic integrity violation and related academic 
sanction at any USF System institution shall affect and be applied to the academic status of the student 
throughout the USF System, unless otherwise determined by the independently accredited institution. The 
process for faculty reporting of academic misconduct, as well as the student’s options for appeal, are outlined in 
detail in USF System Regulation 3.027 . 
 
I have a zero -tolerance policy  for plagiarism or cheating.  Plagi arism includes claiming/editing others’ work and 
presenting it as your own, lifting materials from the Internet or other sources without attribution, and many 
others. Per USF policy, any such behavior will result in a zero grade for that grade component fo r the first 
offense, F grade in the class and report to the Dean’s Office for the second offense, and dismissal from the 
program for third offense. There will be no make up for any plagiarized work. See USF’s academic integrity 
policy at http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/AcademicIntegrityOfStudents.pdf . 
 
Disruption to Academic Progress: Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. 
Disruption of the acade mic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a classroom or 
other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the instructor: (a) directs attention away from 
the academic matters at hand, such as noisy distrac tions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of 
lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the health, 
safety, or well -being of self or other persons.  
 
Academic Grievance Procedure: The pur pose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate 
students taking courses within the University of South Florida System an opportunity for objective review of 
facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. An “academ ic grievance” is a claim that a 
specific academic decision or action that affects that student’s academic record or status has violated published 
policies and procedures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other 
students. 
 
Disability Access: Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Students with Disabilities 
Services (SDS) (SVC 1133) in order to receive academic accommodations. SDS encourages students to notify 
instructors of accommodation nee ds at least five (5) business days prior to needing the accommodation. A letter 
from SDS must accompany this request.  
 
Sexual Misconduct / Sexual Harassment : USF is committed to providing an environment free from sex 
discrimination, including sexual harass ment and sexual violence ( USF System Policy 0 -004). The USF Center 
for Victim is a confidential resource where you can talk about incidents of sexual harassmen t and gender -based 
crimes including sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence. This confidential resource can help 
you without having to report your situation to either the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities  (OSSR) or 
the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Equal Opportunity  (DIEO), unless you request that they make a report. 
Please be aware that i n compliance with Title IX and under the USF System Policy, educators must report 
incidents of sexual harassment and gender -based crimes including sexual assault, stalking, and 
domestic/relationship violence. If you disclose any of these situations in clas s, in papers, or to me personally, I 
am required to report it to OSSR or DIEO for investigation. Contact the USF Center for Victim Advocacy and 
Violence Prevention : (813) 974- 5757. 
                                                 
2 Not all USF policies are listed in the syllabus to save space, students should refer to this link for current or updated 
policies in effect:  https://www.usf.edu/prov ost/faculty/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx  Syll_QMB7565_IntroRM_F23_20Aug2023v2skm         15 of 16 
 15  
Relig ious Observances : All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate 
their religious observances, practices and beliefs ( USF System Policy 10 -045). The USF System, through its 
faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required classes and examinations in view of customarily observed 
religious holidays of those religious groups or communities comprising the USF System’s constituency. 
Students are expected to attend classes and take examinations as determined by the USF System. No student 
shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious 
belief. However, studen ts should review the course requirements and meeting days and times to avoid 
foreseeable conflicts, as excessive absences in a given term may prevent a student from completing the 
academic requirements of a specific course. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the beginning of 
each academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in accordance with this 
Policy.  
 
Statement of Academic Continuity : In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to suspend 
normal operations. During this time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that 
include, but are not limited to: Learning Management System, online conferencing, email messaging, and/or an 
alternate schedule. It is the responsi bility of the student to monitor the Learning Management System for each 
class for course- specific communication, and the main USF, College, and Department websites, emails, and 
MoBull messages for important general information ( USF System Policy 6 -010). For additional guidance on 
emergency protective actions and hazards that affect the University, please visit www.usf.edu/e m  
 
End of Semester Student Evaluations:  All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide 
feedback to the University regarding the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of the semester, 
and the University will notif y you by email when the response window opens. Your participation is highly 
encouraged and valued.  
 
Campus Free Expression ( As of Fall 2022) : The following statement was crafted as a suggested 
statement to include for courses that engage in discussions and instruction which students may find 
uncomfortable, unwelcome, disagreeable, or even offensive. These discussions are intended to be 
objective. Additional guidance related to HB 7 “Individual Freedom Act” can be found online.  
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where 
divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. 
Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find 
uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an 
endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be 
tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible 
research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that 
certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage 
with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not 
mean that yo u are required to believe it or agree with it.  
 
Use of Generative AI Tools ( Fall 2023 addition ): You are free to explore use of generative AI tools, such as 
(but not limited to) ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing for learning purposes but any assignments must be base d on your own

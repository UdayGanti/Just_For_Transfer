                  				Internships
                  			
There are eight essential skills that employers look for in new hires: communications,
                  critical thinking, global citizenship, leadership, professionalism, team work, technology,
                  and the ability to manage your career. The best way to build these skills is by completing
                  an internship and the Office of Internships and Career Readiness is here to help you
                  find one!

Research shows students who work on campus have higher grades, are more engaged and
                  more likely to graduate on time. Use Handshake to search available jobs on campus
                  and apply online.

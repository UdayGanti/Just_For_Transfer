Fire
USF Environmental Health and Safety maintains the Fire Safety Program at USF.
To be prepared for an emergency situation, you should familiarize yourself with exits
               and fire safety equipment and designate a meeting spot for evacuations. For more information
               on emergency evacuation procedures visit the Fire Safety website.
In the event of a fire:

Pull the manual fire alarm
Always use stairs and not elevators in the case of a fire
Call 9-1-1 as soon as you are safely out of the building
Remain calm while reporting the fire and be as descriptive as possible
Do not return to the building for any reason unless instructed to do so by public
                  safety officials

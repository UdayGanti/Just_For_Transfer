Course Logistics and Communications  
• All email communication sent to me will be through Canvas messaging  (email). This 
allows me to repository all communications through canvas as opposed to my normal 
email. Using Canvas messaging also automatically adds our course information to all 
communic ations, which allows me to quickly identify both student and course enrolled.  
• For all deliverables requiring email communication, it is required to use Canvas 
messaging  (email); You will lose credit for not doing s o. 
• For questions about the course content  or any assignment, please utilize scheduled office 
hours, or call for an appointment. You can also contact me via email.  
• All work should be completed using professional standards. Assignments will be 
submitted via Canvas and submitted to Turnitin.  Please  ensure that you cite any material 
referenced appropriately. If you have any question s, please do not hesitate to ask for 
clarification or assistance.  
• To improve the efficiency and effectiveness in delivering course content, each student 
will be responsibl e for all items contained or emails sent via Canvas.  
• Late Assignments : There are no make -ups for course deliverables. Assignments turned in 
late will be assessed penalties as follows: a ten percent deduction for every 24 hours of 
being late, for up to a ma ximum of fifty percent deduction. For example, if a student 
turns in an assignment less than 24 hours late, a 10 percent point penalty is assessed; and 
if a student turns in an assignment between 48 -72 hours late, a 30 percent penalty is 
assessed. Assignme nts will not be accepted if overdue by more than seven days. 
Deliverables are due by the end of day on the due date (usually this means Sunday 
11:55pm).   
• Re-grade Policy  - All tests and other graded material may be submitted for re -evaluation 
of the grade  by the instructor.  To request a re -grade, you must submit a written request 
within one week of the date the test or assignment was returned.  The written request 
must include a cover sheet that explains (1) The specific test questions or aspects of the 
assignment that you want re -evaluated and  (2) Why the original grade is in error and 
should be reconsidered.  
• In the event of an emergency, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through 
methods that include but are not limited to: Canvas, MS Teams , Skype, and email 
messaging and/or an alternate schedule. It’s the responsibility of the student to monitor © 202 3 Marcus L . Green  
 Canvas for each class for course specific communication, and the main USF, College, 
and department websites, emails, and MoBull messages for import ant general

Attendance Discussion Assignment  
To meet USF’s First Day Attendance requirement , please complete the discussion 
attendance assignment has been set up in Canvas.  Please complete the discussion 
requirement before  Thursday, August 27 , 2023, at 11:59 PM .  You are required to tell us 
a little about yourself. Your response will be used as an agreement that you wish to 
remain in the course. If you do not complete the discussion assignment you will be 
administratively dropped from our course . 
 
Extra Credit Policy  
There are no opportunities for extra credit in this course.  Students’ focus should be on 
the primary work in the course.  
 
Medical Issues   
There are certainly cases in which a student legitimately cannot complete course 
assignments for valid medical reasons.  To be excused from course work in such cases 
requires students to furnish a standard note from a health care professional stating care is 
being sought for an ailment or condition which can impede a student’s ability to complete 
course work.  Without such a note an excuse from course work cannot be granted.  
 
 
 © 202 3 Marcus L . Green  
 Grades of "Incomplete"  
An Incomplete grade ("I") is exceptional and granted at the instructor’s discretion only 
when students are unable to complete course requ irements due to illness or other 
circumstances beyond their control. The course instructor and student must complete and 
sign the "I" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is 
due, and the grade the student would earn fact oring in a zero for all incomplete 
assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long 
as it does not exceed two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for 
graduate courses from the original date grades were  due for that course. An "I" grade not 
cleared within the two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate 
courses (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract . 
 
Academic Standards, Integrity,  and Academic  Misconduct  
Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida System’s 
commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its university community. 
Academic integrity is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include honesty, 
respect, and fairness. Broadly defined, academic honesty is the completion of all 
academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as representative of one’s own 
efforts. The final decision on an academic integrity violation and relate d academic 
sanction at any USF System institution shall affect and be applied to the academic status 
of the student throughout the USF System, unless otherwise determined by the 
independently accredited institution.   The process for faculty reporting of ac ademic 
misconduct, as well as the student’s options for appeal, are outlined in detail in USF 
System Regulation 3.027.  
 
In our course assignments , the professor has several methods for penalizing those who 
engage in academic misconduct.  Among these methods the professor can 1) award 0 
points for an assignment on which a student has engaged in misconduct, 2) award an F in 
the entire course, or 3) award a special FF grade in the course.  An FF appears 
permanently on the student's transcript as a special designation showing the student failed 
the course for reasons of academic misconduct.   The FF includes expulsion from the 
University.  
 
All students must review the syllabus and the requirements, including the online terms 
and video testing requirements, to determine if they wish to remain in the course. 
Enrollment in the course is an agreement to abide by and accept all terms.  Any student 
may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period.   
 
Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, 
students will be required to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a m icrophone when 
taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is 
purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence 
must be done with the permission of any person residing in the residence.   
 
To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. 
Students with concerns may discuss location of an appropriate space for the recordings 
with their instructor or advisor.   © 202 3 Marcus L . Green  
  
Students must ensure that any recordi ngs do not invade any third -party privacy rights and 
accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party privacy concerns.   
 
Committing academic misconduct in this course will result in a failing (F) grade for the 
course.  In such a c ase the course will need to be taken again in order to complete the 
MS-BAIS degree.  Other penalties may be applied by the Muma College of Business.  
Particularly egregious cases will result in a Double -FF (FF) grade being awarded, which 
will lead to expulsion from our program and the University of South Florida.  
 
Web Posting Course Materials  
Students are reminded that posting course materials to third -party sites such as Course 
Hero or Chegg represents a violation of the professor’s copyright on those materials and 
constitutes theft of intellectual property.    
 
Disruption to Academic Process  
Disruptiv e students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Disruption of 
the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a 
classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the 
instructor: (a) directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy 
distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic 
discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the heal th, safety, 
or well -being of self or other persons.  
 
Student Academic Grievance Procedures  
The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students 
taking courses within the University of South Florida System an opportunity fo r objective 
review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. An 
“academic grievance” is a claim that a specific academic decision or action that affects 
that student’s academic record or status has violated published policies an d procedures or 
has been applied to the grievant in a manner different from that used for other students.  
 
Attendance Policy  
Students are expected to exhibit professionalism through regular and on -time attendance 
to class lectures , whether those lectures are offered live or online . Accommodat ion will 
be made for excused absences by making arrangements with students ahead of time 
(when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work.    
 
Group Work Policy  
Everyone must take part in a group project. All members of a group will receive the same 
score; that is, the project is assessed and everyone receives this score. Once formed, 
groups cannot be altered or switched, except for reasons of extended hospitalization.  
 
Final Examination s Policy  © 202 3 Marcus L . Green  
 All final exams are to be scheduled in accordance with the University’s final examination 
policy.  
 
Course Policies: Technology and Media  
 
Netiquette Guidelines  
1. Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers 
with respect, the same way you would do in a face -to-face environment. Respect other 
people’s ideas and be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not 
agree with.   
2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. 
There will be people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and 
religious beliefs or other general differences.   
3. Proofread and check sp elling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a 
thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and 
thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, 
and it is more difficul t to read.  
4. Keep your communications focused and stay on topic. Complete your ideas 
before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to 
easily get your idea or answers they are looking for.  
5. Be clear with your messag e. Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can’t 
see your expressions or hear your tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.  
 
Email  
The primary means of communication between instructor and students between live class 
meetings will be email.  “Blast emails” will occasionally be sent by the instructor to all 
students via Canvas.  Students can feel free to email their instructor with que stions at any 
time.  Please anticipate a response time of 24 hours to email queries.   
 
Laptop Usage  
Laptop or mobile computing device usage is encouraged during this course. Students are 
allowed to use devices for recording class sessions for personal use . 
 
Phone Usage  
Students are allowed to use devices for recording lectures for their personal use, though 
students must still adhere to classroom behavioral expectations while recording. Students 
attending the in -person lectures are asked to place their mob ile phones on “silent” and to 
step outside the classroom to take any important calls.  Phones may not be used during 
in-class assignments.  
 
Recordings   
In this class, software will be used to record live class lectures and discussions. As a 
student in this class, your participation in live class discussions will be recorded. These 
recordings will be made available only to students enrolled in the class, t o assist those © 202 3 Marcus L . Green  
 who cannot attend the live session or to serve as a resource for those who would like to

The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may not use websites that 
enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This 
does apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – almost any use of these 
websites (including uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the 
academic integrity policy.  
 
Professionalism Policy  
Per university policy and classroom etiquette; mobile phones, iPods, etc. must be 
silenced  during all classroom and lab le ctures. Those not heeding this rule will be asked 
to leave the classroom/lab immediately so as to not disrupt the learning environment. 
Please arrive on time for all class meetings. Students who habitually disturb the class by 
talking, arriving late, etc.,  and have been warned may suffer a reduction in their final 
class grade.  
 
 
 
 
End of Semester Student Evaluations  
All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide feedback to the 
University regarding the course. These surveys will be  made available at the end of the 
semester, and the University will notify you by email when the response window opens. 
Your participation is highly encouraged and valued.  
 
Food and Drink Policy  
Please adhere to the firm policy of no beverages (other than bottled/capped water), food, 
tobacco products, or like items in the classroom. Your understanding of the necessity for 
this policy and cooperation will be greatly appreciated. This policy will be  strictly 
enforced.  
 
Turnitin.com  
In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which 
instructors may use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions © 202 3 Marcus L . Green  
 of web sites, as well as an enormous database  of student papers that grows with each 
submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all assignments in both hard 
copy and electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a 
report from turnitin.com that states if an d how another author’s work was used in the 
assignment. For a more detailed look at this process visit http://www.turnitin.com . Essays 
are due at turnitin.com the same day as in class .  
 
Disability Access  
Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Students with Disabilities 
Services (SDS) to receive academic accommodations. SDS encourages students to notify 
instructors of accommodation requests at least 5 business  days prior to needing the 
accommodation. A letter from SDS must accompany this request.  
Religious Observances  
All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate their 
religious observances, practices and beliefs. If you o bserve religious holidays, you should 
plan your allowed absences to include those dates.  
 
Campus Free Expression   
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment 
where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically 
evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussio n of ideas 
that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and 
not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the 
idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the 
idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may 
decide that certain ideas are worthy of  your personal belief. In this course, however, you 
may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the 
ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree 
with it . 
 
Make -up Exams Policy   
If a student cannot be present for an examination for a valid reason (validity to be 
determined by the instructor), a make -up exam will be given only if the student has 
notified the instructor in advance that s/he cannot be present for the exam. Make -up 
exams are given at the convenience of the instructor usually on Fridays at 10 am . 
 
Rewrites Policy   
Rewrites are entirely optional; however, only the formal essay may be rewritten for a 
revised grade. Note that an alternate grading rubric will be used for t he rewrite, featuring 
an additional column that evaluates the changes made specifically . 
 
Exams Retention P olicy   © 202 3 Marcus L . Green

Essay Commentary Policy  
Commentary on essays will be delivered in written format, at the end of the essay. 
However, upon request, an alternate delivery method can be used. If desired, instructor 
comments will b e made verbally and delivered to the student as an mp3 through Canvas. 
This approach yields far fewer written comments, but much more commentary in general 
is delivered, due to the speed and specificity of speech. Those requesting mp3 feedback 
must state s o when the essay is turned in.

The Department of Emergency Management (EM) is a university-wide function based out
               of the Tampa campus that coordinates activities to protect, prevent and mitigate against;
               respond to; and recover from disasters and emergencies affecting the University. Using
               an all-hazards approach, USF EM coordinates emergency operations to enhance a safe

               and crisis situations. The University is committed to serving our students, faculty,
               staff, and visitors through a variety of preventative and responsive programs and

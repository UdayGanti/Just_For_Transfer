Course Descrip,on: As organizations gather and access more and more data, the issue of knowledge management in general and business intelligence and data analytics in particular takes on an increasing importance for organizational success. However, while the various business intelligence tools often offer important information, in order for such information to be useful from an organizational point of view, it needs to be presented in a way that is accessible. Data/Information visualization is widely used in several industries, including business, engineering, and media disciplines to help people analyze and understand what the data is telling us. The visualization field has grown exponentially over the last few years, and thus there are more tools available to help us quickly and efficiently create compelling ways to understand data. 
This course examines how to present insights gained through the application of business intelligence techniques in the most effective way to tell stories that can improve the quality of leadership decisions. Course Objectives: At the conclusion of this course, students are expected to be able to: 1. Discuss the importance of data visualization in improving data-driven organizational decision-making. 2. Distinguish between truthful visualizations and misleading visualizations, and discuss what makes a visualization truthful or misleading. 3. Use data visualization tools to produce quality visualizations. 4. Create visualizations in at least one programming language. 5. Use widely used data visualization tools to clearly, effectively and compellingly communicate insights to improve organizational decision making. Course Material Required: NONE Optional: Healy, K.

Grading You will be assessed using a number of different assessment tools, including • A number of smaller projects. • A few graded discussions.  The graded discussions require you to make an initial contribution by Thursday and the follow ups by Sunday or earlier.   • The larger project in which you will conduct data analysis and data visualization on a data set, preferably of your own choosing, and • A reflective essay on what you learned in the course and how you could use the competencies acquired in the course in your professional career. Unless otherwise indicated, the deadline for all the assignments is Sunday. The link of most of the assessments to the course objectives will be clear. The only assessment instrument that needs justification is the reflective essay. Research (see e.g. http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/principles/learning.html) has shown that learning improves considerably, especially for adult students, if students reflect on their learning and how they could use the competencies and knowledge that they acquired in a course through their own careers. There will be more details on what to include in the essay later on in the course. Since the project is such a large part of the overall grade for the course, you are welcome to submit an early draft of the project, and there will be a number of graded discussions in which you are asked to report on the progress of your project and on any issues you are running into.  The project will consist of a written report and several visualizations in whatever tool you choose (Tableau or Power BI).  You will also be asked to make a project presentation, consisting of a 5-minute video. Your grade will be determined as follows: Assessment total Mini projects 290 Small Graded Discussions 55 Large Graded Discussion 80 Reflective essay 30 Project Presentation 30 Final Project 200 Total 685 Your raw numerical grade will be converted to a letter grade according to the following table: A+ >= 96.5% <= 100% A >= 93% < 96.5% A- >= 90% < 93% B+ >= 86.5% < 90% B >= 83% < 86.5% B- >= 80% < 83% C+ >= 76.5% < 80% C >= 73% < 76.5% C- >= 70% < 73% D+ >= 66.5% < 70% D >= 63% < 66.5% D- >= 60% < 63% F  < 60%   Provisional Schedule Date Topics Assessments May 15  “Getting Started”  “Introduction to Data Visualization” Syllabus Discussion Discussion on Misleading and Truthful visualizations May 22 “Telling Stories with Data and a First Introduction to Tableau” Discussion on Initial Project Ideas Some simple Tableau Visualizations Tableau Exercise 1 May 29 “Data Preparation in Tableau”  Tableau Exercise 2 June 5 “Combining Visualizations, Animations & Parameters in Tableau”  Discussion on Data Visualization and Visual Impairment Tableau Exercise 3 June 12 Power BI Part 1 Project Progress Discussion 1 Power BI Exercise 1 June 19 Power BI Part 2 Power BI Exercise 2 June 26 Data Visualization in Python Python Exercise July 3 Data Visualization in R R Exercise Project Progress Discussion 2 July 10 Project Project report, including visualizations Project presentation Reflection Paper   Important dates: • May 29, Memorial Day, USF offices closed. • June 19, Juneteeth holiday, USF offices closed. • July 1, Last day to eithdraw, No refund and no academic penalty. • July 4, Independence Day, USF office closed Course Policies Contacting the Instructor: The easiest way to contact me is through CANVAS. I typically log in at least once a day, and often more frequently, and this includes weekends. You can also reach me by email as reichgelt@usf.edu or on my mobile 678-314-4432. I will normally answer you within 24 hours and often more quickly, unless I have indicated through a course announcement that I may not be able to.  If you want to meet me in person, please make an appointment.  I realize that some of you will be working full-time and that it will not always be convenient for you to meet during regular office hours, or in my office, and we can therefore be flexible both regarding time and place. Communications from the Instructor: I will in general communicate with you through course emails and course announcements, and it is therefore crucial that you log in at least twice a week to make sure that there are no new messages from me.  I will also communicate with you by leaving comments on the various assignments that you complete.  It is important that you read these even if you earned the maximum grade on the assignment because I often make some comments on how you could further improve the assignment. Deadlines: I will strictly enforce deadlines and will typically not grade work if it is submitted after the deadline. Since the technology is still not 100% reliable, I would encourage you not to wait until the last moment before you start working on your assignments. Also, as you are working, please save your work often, preferably both on your computer and on some back-up storage device, such as a USB drive. In return, you can expect me to grade your work within 48 hours for the larger assignments and more quickly for the smaller assignments.  University Policies: USF has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, religious observances, academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual harassment that apply to all courses at USF.  Be sure to review these online at: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspx    Honor System: Under the USF Honor System, each student is expected to observe complete honesty in all academic matters.  Violation of the Honor System will be referred to the Honor Council.  Note: The following are violations of the Honor Code:  Copying another student’s homework, signing another student’s name on the attendance roster, copying another group’s disk or written work, using another student’s computer disk to print out your assignment, copying another student’s file onto your disk, and misrepresenting a reason for a missed exam.  Punishment for academic dishonesty may result in an automatic “F” or “FF” in the course or action that may result in suspension or expulsion. See the USF Policy on Academic Dishonesty & Disruption of the Academic Process at hops://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/students/academic-integrity-of-students   Students with Accessibility Issues: Please notify your instructor by the second week if you have a learning disability or require special assistance with this course.  For additional information about academic accommodations and resources, you can visit the SAS website at https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-accessibility/   We have made every effort to make the course material as accessible as possible.  However, we rely heavily Canvas in this course.  Consult https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2061.  for the accessibility practices policies for Canvas.  If you run into accessibility problems with either, please contact me. S/U Grades: This course cannot be taken on an S/U basis. Title IX and Responsible Employees: All USF faculty (adjunct, TA, etc) are designated Responsible Employees.

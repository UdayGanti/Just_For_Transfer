Building Emergency Action Plan
Building Emergency Action Plans are useful reference tools for building occupants
               to use in the event of a number of natural, manmade, or technological emergencies.
Building Supervisors can maintain and update these plans with a variety of maps, critical
               building supplies, and other emergency procedures unique to a specific building.
Building Supervisors should contact the Department of Emergency Management at usf-emergencymgmt@usf.edu or (813) 974-0870 and we will provide a template and walk you through the planning
               process.

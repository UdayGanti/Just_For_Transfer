Course O bjectives  
This course will introduce distributed information systems including presentation technologies such as 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as data visualization frameworks. We will introduce students to popular 
web application development frameworks  and the net work stack so students can analyze, design, 
implement,  and manage distributed information systems. In this process the student will develop skill in 
applying the principles of telecommunications and networks  and explore how to bring their data science 
mode ls to a wide audience .  
Learning Outcomes12 
1. Develop proficiency in using html and css for web user interfaces  
2. Introduce Java Script  (JS) and JS frameworks for client -side user interaction  
3. Introduce data visualization technologies  
4. Introduce web application development frameworks  
5. Introduce networking stack (ex. TCP/IP)

1. All students should have access to an installation of Visual Studio  Code . If needed, please seek an 
appointment with the TA in the first week of class to complete the required setup.   
2. Faculty teaching this class (in particular, Prof. Clinton Daniel) are creating video walk -throughs to 
help students with the hands -on components. These videos are designed to be viewed and followed 
before class meetings so that class time can be used to help students overcome any technical 
challenges with implementing the concepts covered.  Links to these videos are available on Canvas.  
3. Students will form groups to complete projects. Follow instructions on Canvas for group  size.  All 
students should sign up on the groups pre -created for the class, do not create new group sets . In 
case of group dysfunction, students may fire disruptive members, or sub-groups may create their 
own group  at any time . 
4. Please u se the term “ ISM 6225 ” in the subject line of your email to help me filter emails.  
5. Readings and assignment deliverables are specified on the course site  on Canvas . 
6. Deliverables are due by the end of day on the due date (usually this means 11:55pm).  The default 
due days are Sundays,  but adaptations are made to accommodate calendar and scheduling issues.  
7. Make up opportunities are not likely to be necessary in this class. In case they do, they will only be 
provided for job -related situations and for medical  emergencies in the immediate  family.  
8. The instructors conduct all sections of the course with the same calendar tightly in sync. 
Accordingly, students can reach out to any instructor of the course to expand the availability of 
office hours .   
Business Continuity   
In the event of an emergency, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that  
include but are not limited to: Canvas, Teams , and email messaging and/or an alternate  schedule. It’s 
the responsibility of the student to monitor Canvas for each class for cou rse specific  communication, 
and the main USF, College, and department websites, emails, and MoBull messages for  important 
general information.  
Presentation  
To help build your communication skills, e ach group will be required to present their application  to the 
class. Please use the instructions in the presentation assignment for details.

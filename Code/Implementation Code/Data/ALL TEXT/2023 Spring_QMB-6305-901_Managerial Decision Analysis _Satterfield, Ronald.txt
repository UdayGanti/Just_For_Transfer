text problem numbers, chapter o rganization, and problem data ma y have changed. 
 
SOFTWARE: Microsoft Excel, Minitab, and R with R Studio.  Excel and Minit ab are 
available to USF students free of  charge via apps.usf.edu.  For  any technical assistance you need 
in gaining access call USF Tech Support at 974-1222.  Minitab a lso offers 30-day free trials of 
its software via direct downloa d and academic licenses for stud ents at nominal cost.  R and R 
Studio are both open source and available online as free downlo ads.  Install R first from www.r-
project.org , then install R Studio from www.rstudio.com .  The free version of R Studio Desktop 
is recommended. There are numerous online sites that can give y ou assistance if needed with 
these tasks.  We will begin the course using these packages, so  it is strongly recommended you 
have them installed and available for use on your machine.   
 
Additionally, we will be using several common add-in packages w ith R.  They can be installed 
all at once or individually.  To in stall these packages all at once copy and paste the following 
command into R/R Studio.  
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "car", "Hmisc", "rio", 
"moments", "corrplot", "MASS"),dep=TRUE) 
 
To install them individually an example line of code would be: 
 
install.packages("rio") 
 
As R and R Studio are open source and extremely popular in the business analytics community, 
you will find numerous sources online to help you use them.  Yo u're encouraged to use those 
sources as needed.

 COURSE DESCRIPTION  
 
Modern business statistics encom passes the collection, analysis , presentation, and use of data to 
assist in the decision-making pr ocess.  Statistics can be thoug ht of as the science and art of 
making sense of numerical data.  C omputer hardware and software , especially via R and R 
Studio, has given the ability to a nalyze immense amounts of dat a.  Thus statistics has emerged as 
one of the essential keys to good man agement and critical today  to the important field of 
business analytics.  Virtually every manager at least occasiona lly needs to deal with data whether 
in maintaining or improving regul ar day-to-day operations or fi nding new opportunities.  Also, 
managers need to be able to comm unicate with analytical profess ionals to express needs and 
understand the results of  analytics projects. 
 This course introduces you to the  essentials of statistics and statistical progra mming.  The ideas 
in the course are organized ar ound several main topics: How to gather data, how to summarize 
raw data into information, how t o use limited information to ma ke predictions and inferences 
about problems of interest, a nd how to build models to aid deci sion making.  Statistical software 
will be used heavily in this course  as analysis today is nearly  always done with these tools. 
  This course teaches the basic statistical tools used in quantit ative analysis in bus iness.  After a 
brief review of basic concepts, measures of central tendency an d dispersion, and probability 
distributions, the course will concentrate on confidence interv als, hypothesis tests, regression, 
and correlation.  The emphasis wi ll be on applications, concept s and interpretation of results, 
rather than derivati ons and calculations. 
 The problems listed on the sylla bus are found in Berenson/Levin e/Krehbiel/Stephan, our main 
text.  It is recomme nded that you work as many problems as you need to gain competence with 
the material after listening t o the lectures.  Some of the prob lems should be worked by hand, 
others with software.   
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

requirements by the end of the s ucceeding semes ter.  “I” grades  not replaced by the end 
of the subsequent semester will  be changed to “IF” and are a fa iling grade for the course. 
 
Email  
The primary means of communicat ion between instructor and stude nts between live class 
meetings will be email.  “Blast  emails” will occasionally be se nt by the instructor to all 
students via Canvas.  Students can  feel free to email their ins tructor with questions at any 
time.  Please anticip ate a response time of 24 hours to email q ueries.   
 
Canvas  
Canvas will be used in this course to disseminate materials tur n in weekly assignments 
and return graded assignments .  If you need help learning how t o perform various tasks 
related to this or other courses in Canvas, please consult the Canvas help guides. You 
may also contact USF's IT s upport at (813) 974-1222 or help@usf .edu. 
 
Laptop Usage  
Laptop/Tablet usage is encouraged  in this course given the natu re of the material.   
 
Classroom Recording  
Audio and/or video recordings of l ectures are prohibited, as is  the live streaming of 
lectures or dissemination of lec tures via conference calling te chnologies.

Academic Integrity  and Academic Misconduct  
Academic integrity is the founda tion of the University of South  Florida System’s 
commitment to the academic honest y and personal integrity of it s university 
community. Academic integrity i s grounded in certain fundamenta l values, which 
include honesty, respect, and fairness. Broadly defined, academ ic honesty is the 
completion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly kn owledge as 
representative of one’s own effo rts. The final decision on an a cademic integrity 
violation and relate d academic sanction at any USF System insti tution shall affect and © 2023 Ronald K. Satterfield 
 be applied to the academic status of the student throughout the  USF System, unless 
otherwise determined by the inde pendently accredited institutio n.  The process for 
faculty reporting of academic misconduct, as well as the studen t’s options for appeal, 
are outlined in detail in USF System Regulation 3.027.  
 
In our course assignments the prof essor has several methods for  penalizing those who 
engage in academic misconduct.  A mong these methods the profess or can 1) award 0 
points for an assignmen t on which a student  has engaged in misc onduct, 2) award an F 
in the entire course, or 3) awar d a special FF grade in the cou rse.  An FF appears 
permanently on the student's tra nscript as a special designatio n showing the student 
failed the course for reasons of academic misconduct.  
Disruption to Academic Process   
Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educatio nal process. Disruption 
of the academic process is defi ned as the act, words, or genera l conduct of a student in a 
classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable  estimation of the 
instructor: (a) directs attenti on away from the academic matter s at hand, such as noisy 
distractions, persistent, disres pectful or abusive interruption  of lecture, exam, academic 
discussion, or general Univers ity operations, or (b) presents a  danger to the health, 
safety, or well-being of self or other persons. 
 Student Academic Grievance Procedures   
The purpose of these procedures  is to provide all undergraduate  and graduate students 
taking courses within the Univers ity of South Florida System an  opportunity for 
objective review of facts and event s pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. 
An “academic grievance” is a clai m that a specific academic dec ision or action that 
affects that student ’s academic record or status has violated p ublished policies and 
procedures or has been applied to the grievant in a manner diff erent from th at used for 
other students. 
 Disability Access  
Students with disabilities are re sponsible for registering with  Students with Disabilities 
Services (SDS) to receive academic accommodations. SDS encourag es students to 
notify instructors of accommodation requests at least 5 busines s days prior to needing 
the accommodation. A letter from SDS must accompany this reques t.

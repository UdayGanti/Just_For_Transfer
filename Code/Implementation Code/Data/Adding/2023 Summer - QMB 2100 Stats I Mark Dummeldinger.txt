Covid-19 Procedures
All students must comply with university policies and posted signs regarding COVID-19 mitigation measures, including wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing during in-person classes. Failure to do so may result in dismissal from class, referral to the Office of Student Conduct and Ethical Development, and possible removal from campus. Additional details are available on the University’s Core Syllabus Policy Statements page: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspxLinks to an external site.

Online Proctoring
Quizzes and examinations may be conducted using online proctoring tools. Keeping the audio and video (microphone and camera) on during such exams and quizzes is a must. If the student is not willing to use these, the student is asked not to register for this course. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period. Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this  remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with the permission of  any person residing in the residence. To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University library  and other academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for recordings, and students with concerns may discuss the location of an  appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third-party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third-party privacy concerns. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the proctored exam.

If you are close to the next higher grade at the end of the semester, I will look at your final exam to determine if you deserve a bump up to the next higher grade.
6.   Assigned Homework Problems:  The following is a list of recommended problems the student should attempt to master the necessary skills presented during the class. While not collected, these problems enable the student to test their  knowledge of the statistical methods introduced in both the lectures and the text. Other problems should be worked in areas
causing difficulty. A solutions manual to the odd numbered problems is available to the student at the bookstore and online and answers to these problems are posted within Canvas.
Note: To reduce confusion. Note that problem 2 in Chapter 1 is listed in the text as Exercise 1.2. Problem 20 will be listed as Exercise 1.20. 
Exercises designated in red indicate the problem requires extensive computer assistance. Printouts for these problems are posted in Canvas and should be consulted while attempting these problems. As another option, students could attempt to generate the printouts themselves using the Statistix software. Demonstrations on how to use the software are posted online. 
University Policies:
Policies about accessibility, religious observances, academic grievances, academic misconduct, and several other topics are governed by a central set of policies, which apply to all classes at USF: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspx

Final Examinations Policy - all final examinations are to be scheduled in accordance with the University's
final examination policy.

"I" GRADE: Students who are unable to complete all requirements of the course for circumstances beyond their control may request to receive an "I" grade to allow for completion of the remaining coursework the next semester(s).

EARLY NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR OBSERVED RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS:
USF Policy 10-045: Students who anticipate the necessity of being absent from class due to the observation of a major religious observance must provide notice of the date(s) to the instructor, in writing, at the beginning of the term.

GENDER-BASED CRIMES/SEXUAL MISCONDUCT/SEXUAL HARASSMENT (INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE): USF Policy 0-004. USF has a commitment to the safety and well-being of our students. Please be aware that educators must report incidents of sexual harassment and gender-based crimes including sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence that come to their attention. I am required to report such incidents in order for the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Equal Opportunity can investigate the incident or situation as a possible violation of the USF Sexual Misconduct/Sexual Harassment Policy and provide assistance to the student making the disclosure. If you disclose in class or to me personally, I must report the disclosure and will assist you in accessing available resources. The Center for Victim Advocacy and Violence Prevention, the Counseling Center and Student Health Services are confidential resources where you can talk about such situations and receive assistance without the incident being reported.

GENERAL ATTENDANCE POLICY: Students are expected to attend classes. Faculty must inform students of attendance requirements on syllabi. Instructors should accommodate excused absences by making arrangements with students ahead of time (when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work.
 
Additional Accessibility Accommodations Policies: Accommodated Quizzes, Tests and Exams: SAS administers more than 7,000 exams to the USF community each academic year. The student is responsible for scheduling accommodated tests and exams with SAS. Students must schedule with SAS at least one full week before the requested test date. Students who miss this deadline complete a Late Exam Request Form requiring an instructor signature. SAS schedules late exam requests as space allows and as close to the original test date as possible. Due to the volume of tests and exams SAS manages, SAS cannot provide accommodated testing space for "pop" or unscheduled quizzes. Consult with SAS for information on accommodating unscheduled quizzes. 

Make-up Exams: Students who are taking a make-up exam due to disability reasons (medical issues, scheduling conflicts with other courses and extended exam time, disability related appointments etc.) should be allowed to take a make-up exam within 10 business days of the student's return to classes. SAS schedules make-up exams as space allows.

Online Proctoring such as Proctorio: Consult with SAS prior to a student who utilizes accommodations using Proctorio. Some SAS students have atypical testing behaviors. Other SAS students utilize adaptive software that does not collaborate well with Proctorio software.

Laptop or Electronic Device Usage: If prohibiting laptop, phone, or electronic device usage in class, keep in mind that some SAS students utilize such devices for note taking and recording. Still others have medical applications on cell phones that the student cannot turn off (blood sugar monitors, medication alerts etc.) Policies that indicate, "Only those with accommodations may use such devices" inadvertently draw attention to the student with the accommodation. SAS suggests using language that indicates, "Students utilizing laptops, cell phones or other electronic devices for non-academic reasons during class time may be penalized . . . ." 

Clicker Accessibility: Consult with SAS about alternatives to clicker points. Many SAS students have disabilities that affect the ability to answer clicker questions.

Attendance/Participation Accommodations Apply to all courses – Even on-line: If a student has attendance or participation accommodations, SAS provides an "Attendance/Participation Accommodation Form" as part of the student's accommodation letter. This form is tool intended to guide a conversation between a student and instructor about missed courses, missed deadlines and the procedures to follow when requesting extensions. The accommodation does not allow a student to miss an indefinite number of classes or deadlines. Instructors may always consult with SAS to determine what is reasonable.

Accessible Materials: USF policy requires that all course materials be accessible to students. Per the USF Caption and Media Access Policy, all media sources must be captioned prior to use. SAS encourages faculty to consider document accessibility. Use the "Style" functions in Microsoft Word and the OCR functions in Adobe to ensure that all course documents are accessible to those who utilize screen reading technology. See the SAS Accessibility Guide for more information: www.sas.usf.edu (under resources).

Organizational Report   
  
Working on an actual case is one of the best ways to understand and appreciate the management 
function and the integrated management applications experience. In groups, you will identify an 
organization that is facing a managerial problem (or opportunity) and propose a course of action 
using the knowledge and skills you have developed through your management courses.   
  
The project can be completed in one of two ways:  
1. You can partner with a local organization, with which you will work directly.  This type  
of project requires a great deal of primary research ; that is, you will need to identify 
and work closely with the organization to gather your own data.  
2. You can research a mid - or large -sized organization of your team’s choosing and 
research it using secondary sources  – sources that are already available like historical 
documents ( 10K, annual reports).  
Your team will serve in the role of a management consulting firm. You will examine and assess 
the organization, identify management issues the organizatio n currently faces, and make 
recommendations for how the organization should address those issues.   
The project is divided into four papers and a group presentation.  The details are as follows:  
Paper 1 :  Identification of one or more specific problems th e organization currently 
faces.  This paper should define the problem, and present data/evidence to discuss why 
this problem is important to the o rganization .  This paper should be three to four pages 
long, not including cover pages and references.     
Pape r 2:  Analysis of the problem(s) you identified in Paper 1. This paper should 
include your analysis of the root causes of the problem (e.g., why does this problem exist 
for the organization). Again, you should rely on data and evidence to support your 
assertions, as well as concepts and principles from previous courses that can help you 
understand why the problem is occurring.  This paper should be five to six pages long, 
not including cover pages and references section.   
Paper 3 :  Recommendations for the o rganization.  This paper should include your 
group’s recommendations for how the organization can fix the problem(s) you identified 
and analyzed in the previous papers. This should include any topics examined in your 
four core management classes – any and all material from MAN, OB, HR, and OA is fair 
to use as the basis for your recommendations.  This paper should be five to six pages 
long, not including cover pages and references section.   
Paper 4 :  Final report. This paper should include all three previou s sections, with 
improvements based on feedback received. Since it is a final report, you should 
condense and summarize the writing with appropriate citations/references. You should 
also include an executive summary at the beginning of the paper. This shou ld be eight to 
10 pages long, not including cover pages and references section . 
   
Presentation : Your group will make three  presentation s, culminating with your final 
report to the class at the end of the semester.  Each group member is expected to speak 
during the presentation s.  An excellent presentation provides concise, useful information about your analysis and how that analysis informs your recommendations. You should 
present your ideas clearly and provide prescriptive advice and suggestions. You may 
incorporate multimedia to make your presentation creative and engaging, such as video 
clips, audio clips, and website demonstration.  
 
Grading Format  for the Report.  The four papers will be graded based on four equally 
important criteria: critical analysis (25%), comprehension (25%), clarity (25%), and 
professionalism (25%).  
Critical analysis : Demonstrate thoughtful, sophisticated, and insightful analysis, as 
opposed to superficial descriptions with no nuance.  
Comprehension : Demonstrate comprehension of the core course materials and topics.  
Clarity : Demonstrate clarity, coherence, and organization of your assertions with 
specific examples or data supporting your argu ment.  
Professionalism : Demonstrate professional writing skills, including proper grammar and 
correct spellings, along with appropriate citations in the main text and the reference list.   
 
Grading Format for the Presentation.  The grading of the presentati on will focus on the 
following criteria: critical analysis (20%), comprehension (20%), organization (20%), 
communication aids (20%), and stage presence (20%).   
Critical analysis : Your analysis is clear and concise with major points emphasized and 
insights  provided. Your analysis also includes clear recommendations and logical 
conclusions.  
Comprehension : You display an excellent grasp of the course materials. You 
demonstrate mastery of contents, applications, and implications. Your discussion is 
focused an d in- depth.  
Organization : Your presentation is clear, concise, and well -organized. Points are easy to 
follow, and transitions between sections are smooth and coordinated.  
Communication  aids: Your presentation is easy to interpret, read, and understand. The 
slides are well -coordinated with content, well -designed, and used effectively.   
Stage presence : You appear confident and at ease. You use notes (if any) well, have 
good eye contact with the audience, and display appropriate gestures.  
 
Group Feedback : At the middle and end of the semester, you will evaluate your team members 
on their contributions to the project. Your grade on this component will reflect your group’s 
overall evaluation of your work.  Please note: if you do not submit an evaluation of t he other 
members of your group, you will automatically receive a zero on this portion of the project.   
Each team member will be evaluated on the following criteria:  
• Timeliness in arriving to meetings and completing assigned work  
• Active participation in meetings and group communication  
• Quantity of work completed  
• Quality of work completed  
• Ease to work with (teamwork)  Case Studies   
  
Five case studies will be assign ed over the course of the semester.  On the weeks when case 
studies are assigned, students are asked to do the following three things: (1) read the case study 
thoroughly, (2) answer the case study questions provided on Canvas, using the Speed Grader 
functi on, and (3) participate in the class discussion board. The case studies and questions will be 
provided on Canvas.  Please see the course schedule for due dates.  
  
Tableau Assignment  (Optional)   
  
As part of the Citizen Data Science certificate program at the Muma College of Business, the 
MAN 4734 course participates in the Tableau portion of the program . The World Economic 
Forum recently published the top ten skills for employment in the next five years. The Tableau 
projects that you will do throughout your time at the Muma College of Business will provide the 
opportunities to learn five of the top ten skills:  
 
• Analytical and critical thinking  
• Problem -solving using data  
• Critical Analysis  
• Creativity  
• Reasoning  
 
The learning outcomes you want to accomplish in completing the Tableau projects are:  
 
• the ability to get business insights from the data analysis that you can visualize and 
explain to not data -savvy people  
• increase your acumen in complex problem -solving  
• improve your creativity and critical business decision making ability  
develop your logical reasoning    
 
Students will collect and analyze data and then produce visualizations/dashboards to form 
conclusions and insights regarding that data. Each student will produce a 3 -minute video 
responding to a set of questions about their findings, and then upload the vi deo to Canvas under 
the “Tableau Citizen Data Science Certificate Project” tab. Additional details regarding this 
assignment will be provided in class and on Canvas.  
 
USF SYSTEM POLICIES  
  
Policies and regulations are available at regulationspolicies.usf .edu  
  
Academic Integrity  
Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida’s commitment to the 
academic honesty and personal integrity of its university community. Academic integrity is 
grounded in certain fundamental values, which  include honesty, respect, and fairness. Broadly 
defined, academic honesty is the completion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly 
knowledge as representative of one’s own efforts. The process for faculty reporting of academic 
misconduct a nd the student’s options for appeal, are outlined in detail in USF Regulation  3.027 . Plagiarism from external sources, peers’ work, and your own previous work  is strictly 
prohibited. If you use ideas from others or yourselves, you must provide appropriate 
citat ions. Academic integrity is serious ! Please refer to university policies for guidance.  
 
Academic Grievance Procedure  
The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and graduate students taking 
courses at the University of South Florida a n opportunity for objective review of facts and 
events pertinent to the cause of the academic grievance. An “academic grievance” is a claim that 
a specific academic decision or action that affects that student’s academic record or status has 
violated publi shed policies and procedures or has been applied to the grievant in a manner 
different from that used for other students.  
  
Disability Access  
Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Students Accessibilty Services 
(SAS) (SVC 1133) in order to receive academic accommodations. SAS encourages students 
to notify instructors of accommodation needs at least five (5) business day s prior to needing 
the accommodation. A letter from SAS must accompany this request. Please visit the Student 
Accessibility Services website  for more information.  
  
Disruption to Academic Progress  
Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the ed ucational process. Disruption of the 
academic process ( USF Regulation 3.025 ) is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a 
student in a classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the 
instructor: (a) directs attent ion away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy 
distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic 
discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the health, safety, or 
well-being  of self or other persons.  
  
Food and Housing Insecurity  
We recognize that student s facing financial difficulty in securing a stable place to live and/or in 
affording needed  groceries may be at risk of these issues affecting class  performance . Students 
with these needs are urged to contact Feed -A-Bull ( feedabull@usf.edu  or their website ), or 
Student Outreach and Support ( socat@usf.edu  or their website ).   
 
Intellectual Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act (House Bill 233)   
 
Preliminary Guidance Document   
 
Students may, without prior notice, record video or audio of a class lecture for a class in which 
the student is enrolled for their own personal, educational use. A class lecture is defined as a 
formal or methodical oral presentation as part of a universi ty course intended to present 
information or teach enrolled students about a particular subject. Recording class activities other 
than class lectures, including but not limited to lab sessions, student presentations (whether 
individually or part of a group ), class discussion, clinical presentations such as patient history, 
academic exercises involving student participation, test or examination administrations, field 
trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the facu lty 
member is prohibited. Recordings may not be used as a substitute for class participation and 
class attendance and may not be published or shared without the written consent of the faculty member. Failure to adhere to these requirements may constitute a  violation of the USF Student  
Conduct Code .   
  
Religious Observances  
All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably accommodate their 
religious observances, practices and beliefs ( USF Policy 10 -045). The University of South 
Florida, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required c lasses and 
examinations in view of customarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or 
communities comprising USF’s constituency. Students are expected to attend classes and take 
examinations as determined by the university. No student sha ll be compelled to attend class or 
sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. However, 
students should review the course requirements and meeting days and times to avoid foreseeable 
conflicts, as excessive class absences may prevent a student from completing the academic 
requirements of a specific course. Students are expected to notify their instructors at the start of 
each academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in 
accordance with this Policy.  
  
Sexual Misconduct / Sexual Harassment  
USF is committed to providing an environment free from sex discrimination, including sexual 
harassment and sexual violence ( USF Policy 0 -004). The USF Center for Victim Advocacy is a 
confidential resource where you can talk about incidents of sexual harassment and gender -based 
crimes including sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence. This confidential 
resource can help you without having to report your situation to the Title IX  Office unless you 
request that they make a report. Contact the USF Center for Victim Advocacy : 813 -974-5757. 
Please be aware that in compliance with Title IX and under the USF Policy, educators must 
report incidents of sexual harassment and gender -based c rimes including sexual assault, 
stalking, and domestic/relationship violence. If you disclose any of these situations personally to 
an educator, he or she is required to report it to the Title IX Office. For more information about 
Title IX, a full list of resources, or to report incidents of sexual harassment, sexual violence, 
relationship violence or stalking visit: usf.edu/title -ix  
  
Statement of Academic Continuity  
In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to suspend normal operations. 
During this time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that include, 
but are not limited to: Canvas, Teams, email messaging, and/or an altern ate schedule. It is the 
responsibility of the student to monitor the Canvas for each class for course -specific 
communication, and the USF, College, and Department websites, emails, and ALERTUSF  
messages for important general information ( USF Policy 6 -010).

TABLEAU CITIZEN DATA SCIENCE CERTIFICATE  
Tableau Citizen Data Science Certificate | Information Systems Decision Sciences | USF Muma College of Business  
Tableau is the fastest -growing data visualization tool in the world. Due to its simplicity, 
versatility, and sheer power Tableau is the leading business intelligence tool in the industry. 
Employers are seeking out hires who can use this tool to help derive  insights from data that can 
solve business challenges.  
To satisfy the current market needs, USF Muma College of Business, in association with 
Tableau, has created a  Citizen Data Science Certificate Program that allows any student who 
earns a degree from t he college a chance to graduate with this additional certification.  
Since 2018, the USF Muma College of Business has embedded Tableau’s visualization platform 
into several courses in its undergraduate curriculum.   Each of these courses has a Tableau 
exerci se where students analyze a dataset, produce visualizations/ dashboards, and tell a story 
that emerges. Every assignment ends with a short video produced by the student, in which the 
student shows how Tableau can be used for a dataset in that course to gen erate important 
business insights.  
Students who want to earn the certificate must make their dashboard interactive and submit at 
least four different YouTube URL projects from four different courses. The Tableau project from 
GEB 4890 – Strategic Management /Executive Decision Making must be one of the four that 
were submitted toward the certification. This certification  is not a requirement for graduation.  
 
THE SPECIFIC COURSES  
 
An initiative such as this requires many departments within a college to coordinate in order to 
determine the courses in which the exercises will be embedded. It is important that the individual 
instructors determine the specifics of the exercise, but they  will all have some common 
characteristics:  
• the students will have a related dataset that makes sense for that course,  
• they will use Tableau’s visualization platform to analyze and come up with stories, 
and 
• they will produce a short video of this exercise so we can evaluate that each student 
did indeed complete the exercise (also, the videos are a great way for students to 
showcase their skills, and we would encourage students to include links to these on 
their Linkedin/resumes).  
After initial discussions w ith Tableau in Fall 2017 we worked with all the individual departments 
and identified the specific courses. Note that three of these courses are common for all students, 
irrespective of the major, some courses are within their individual majors and one is a capstone 
course common for all majors. The specific courses are listed below (note that these may change, 
but the program will ensure that all students have at the minimum four courses in which they 
would have done an assignment as described above). Stud ents typically take this over a two year 
period. So, as they continue to do these assignments across courses they gradually get better at 
Tableau, the art of storytelling, and build a deep understanding for how data drives the future of 
functional roles in  business.  The courses that have this assignment built in are listed below.  
Any three  courses  from  this list will count  towards  the Citizen  Data  Scientist  Certificate:

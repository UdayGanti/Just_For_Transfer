Pre-requisites  : Interest in computers and information security  
Course objectives  
The goal of the course is to introduce skills and knowledge on Information Security and IT Risk 
Management in businesses. The course is open to students in all majors. Course objectives will be 
accomplished through two categories of information – (1) helpi ng students develop technical skills to 
secure computer networks by implementing IT general control s and (2) introducing frameworks that 
comply with legal provisions for the assessment of IT risk in a business environment.  
The course will include class pre sentations and extensive hands -on projects on implementing the common 
IT controls such as access control lists (ACLs), firewalls, network scanning, STIG (Security Technical 
Implementation Guidelines), identifying software errors and documenting some key IT  General Controls. 
Required reports will help students improve their writing and documentation skills.  
A good class combines teaching a trade and thinking about the trade. This class has an approximately 4 0-
60 balance between skills acquisition and concept ual understa nding . 
Specifically, the course objectives are:  
1. To introduce the importance of information security and related business concern.  
2. To make students aware of the major categories of information security threats.  
3. To make students aware of the comm on information security controls.  
4. To enable students to implement the basic information security controls.  
5. To introduce students to the important legal provisions regarding information security.  
6. To make students aware of the methodological implications for  information security arising from 
these legal provisions.  
7. To provide students with an understanding of the standard methodologies for complying with 
legal requirements for IT general controls.  
8. To provide basic understanding of IT risk management in organi zations.  
The student learning outcomes are:  
1. Students will demonstrate an understanding of security concerns and issues in organizations.  
  Information Security and IT Risk Management  
 2. Students will have the ability to identify major categories of information security threat.  
3. Students will have the abil ity to apply various kinds of controls to counter common threats  
4. Students will have the ability to apply best practices related to IT controls to comply with legal 
requirements.  
5. Students will have the ability to provide solutions to mitigate IT risks.  
Logi stics  
1. Students may form groups of t hree students each to complete projects.  
2. Use the phrase “ ISM4323 ” in the subject line of your email  (no spaces) to help me filter emails . 
3. In all deliverables and communication, please include the names of ALL students involved. This is 
needed for allocating grades correctly.  You will lose credit for not doing s o. 
4. Readings and assignment deliverables are always scheduled on the Friday  of the week.  
5. Deliverables are due by the end of day on the due date (usually t his means 11:55pm).  
6. Make up opportunities will only be provided for job -related situations and for medical 
emergencies in the immediate family.  
7. Assignments for each chapter have 5 components – questions, example case, critical thinking, 
hands -on activities and design case. Critical thinking and example case are worth 0.5% each, the 
other activities are worth 1% of the credit for the course.  These assignments can take time, please 
plan your time accordingly.  
8. We will try to manage class time so that as much of the hands -on activity is performed in class as 
possible.  
9. The design case is your opportunity to conduct industry research.  This is your opportunity to 
discover issues, concerns,  products and solutions not discussed in class and apply them within a 
coherent framework to solve customer concerns.   
10. I will do my best to try and teach you something useful, not merely certify what you already know. 
This impacts exam preparation for exam ple, where you should not expect a shortlist of questions 
to prepare . 
11. Subject to availability of time, s elect groups will be invited to present their designs in class  on the 
last day.

Highly recommended resources on Information Security and IT Risk 
Management  
If you have anything more than a passing interest in information security and IT risk management, the 
following books cannot be recommended enough. Information from all these sourc es is used in the class. 
The Anderson book provides detailed managerial coverage of information security problems and 
solutions. The Mandia book has recipes for responding to intrusion s. Perlman’s book has an extra -
ordinarily great presentation of encrypti on algorithms. Westerman’s book describes why IT risk 
management deserves top -management attention and how the major IT risks can be identified.

Weather Ready Nation

USF is taking a proactive approach to prepare for extreme weather, and is currently
               recognized through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as a
               Weather-Ready Nation Ambassador.
The Weather-Ready Nation Ambassador initiative is NOAA’s effort to formally recognize
               NOAA partners who are improving the nation’s readiness, responsiveness, and overall
               resilience against extreme weather, water, and climate events.
As a WRN Ambassador, USF commits to working with NOAA and other Ambassadors to strengthen
               national resilience against extreme weather. In effect, the WRN Ambassador initiative
               helps unify the efforts across government, non-profits, academia, and private industry
               toward making the nation more ready, responsive, and resilient against extreme environmental
               hazards. WRN is a strategic outcome where society’s response should be equal to the
               risk from all extreme weather, water, and climate hazards.

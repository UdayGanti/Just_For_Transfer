The instructor will accommodate students who have to miss assignments or tests due to medical 
emergencies in the immediate family or job -related s situations. These are the only conditions 
under which accommodation will be considered in real -time during th e semester. Should such 
situations arise, the student must provide the necessary documentation before the missed 
deliverable can be rescheduled. Specifically, Bulls games are no grounds for make -ups.  
 
Academic accommodations for disabilities in consultation w ith the Office of Students with 
Disabilities Services will be provided following university procedures.   
 
4 XII. Course Policies: Technology and Media  (include sections as applicable to your course ) 
 
Canvas : This course will be offered via USF's learning management system (LMS), Canvas. If you

Recordings : Some lectures, content and class materials will be made available in a recorded  
format via Canvas. We may also record group sessions where student 's voices and video will be  
included in class recordings. It is the student 's responsibility to make sure the privacy of their  
surroundings and background is maintained .  
 Laptop Usage:  This is a technology class and I encourage to use of computer technology for class 
related activities. Students are allowed and encouraged to use devices for recording class sessions for personal use.

XIII. Course Policies: Student Expectations   
 
Title IX Policy :  
Title IX provides federal protections for discrimination based on sex, which includes 
discrimination based on pregnancy, sexual harassment, and interpersonal violence. In an 
effort to provide support and equal access, USF has designated all faculty (TA, Adjunct, etc.) 
as Responsible Employees, who are required to report any disclosures of sexual harassment, 
sexual violence, relationship violence or stalking. The Title IX Office makes every effort, when 
safe to do so, to reach out and provide resources and accommodations, and to discuss 
possible options for resolution.   Anyone wishing to make a Title IX report or seeking 
accommodations may do so online, in person, via phone, or email to the Title IX Office. For 
information about Title IX or for a full list of resources please visit:  https://www.usf.edu/title -
ix/gethelp/resources.aspx. I f you are unsure what to do, please contact Victim Advocacy – a 
confidential resource that can review all your options – at 813- 974- 5756 or  va@admin.usf.edu . 
 Course Hero  / Chegg  Policy:   
The USF Policy on Academic Integrity
 specifies that students may not use websites that enable 
cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This does apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – almost a ny use of th ese website s (including 
uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy .  
Professionalism Policy:   
Per university policy and classroom etiquette,  mobile phones, iPods, etc. must be silenced  
during all classroom and lab lectures. Those not heeding this rule will be asked to leave the classroom/lab immediately so as to not disrupt the learning environment. Please arrive on 
time for all class meetings. Students who habitually disturb the class by talking, arriving late, 
etc., and have been warned may suffer a reduction in their final class grade.  
  
 
5 Students are expected to adhere to the overall class calendar and to complete work or 
assignments by the due dates posted in Canvas. It will be diffi cult to perform at a high level if 
you do not regularly attend discussion group meetings and actively participate. If you need to miss a group meeting, please send a communication to you team with a copy to the professor in advance. If you will be late with a submission, it's always good to let your professor know in 
advance.  
   
Netiquette Guidelines  
1. Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers with respect, 
the same way you would do in a face -to-face environment. Respect other people 's ideas and 
be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not agre e with.   
2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. There will be 
people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and religious beliefs or other general differences.   
3. Proofread and check spelling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, and it is more difficul t to 
read.  
4. Keep your communications focused and stay on topic. Complete your ideas before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to easily get your idea or answers they are looking for.  
5. Be clear with your messag e. Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can 't see your 
expressions or hear your tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.

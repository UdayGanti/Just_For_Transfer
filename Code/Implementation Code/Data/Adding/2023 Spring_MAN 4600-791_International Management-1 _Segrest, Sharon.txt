Welcome  to International Management! I am looking forward to a great semester and hope you all enjoy this class and learn some 
useful information. Understanding cross -cultural value differences can be very useful when working with individuals from different 
countries internationally or with membe rs of different cultures domestically. This is one of the important competencies associated with 
career readiness . Regardless of the career you choose, it is important to develop your global/intercultural fluency.  
“Global/Intercultural Fluency:  Value, res pect, and learn from diverse cultures, races, ages, genders, sexual orientations, and religions. 
The individual demonstrates, openness, inclusiveness, sensitivity, and the ability to interact respectfully with all people a nd understand 
individuals’ differe nces. ” (see http://www.naceweb.org/career-readiness/competencies/career-readiness-defined/  A n overall objective 
of this course is to help you develop your global/intercultura l fluency.  
Course Description and Purpose:  Examines the effects of international cultural differences on business practices within and outside 
the United  States  and provides  methods  to build  synergies  and establish/enhance  competitive  advantage  via those  differences.  This 
course is designed to challenge you to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways in which culture affects manag ement 
decisions;  to examine  more  closely  your  own  assumptions,  values,  and  beliefs  and  consider  how  they  may  affect  cross-cultural 
management  situations;  and to become  more  familiar  with  the values  of different  countries,  cultures,  and their  management  styles.  
International Management is an eclectic field which emphasizes culture’s effect on the manag erial process and is based on disciplines 
such as the following:  anthropology, psychology, sociology, religion, history, and political science.

multiple -choice  questions. Study guides and practice questions for the exams will be posted  and review will be available to those who

or “yes” answer. Please elaborate. Late assignments will be penalized 10 points/day, so please prepare ahead of time to allow  for 
emergency situations such as illnes s or computer problems. Submissions  with numerous  typos/ grammatical errors cannot earn a grade 
higher than a “C”, so please check your papers for errors. The write -ups of the International Spotlight cases  for each chapter are due

questions . Researching and including supplemental material in addition to the case information is strongly encouraged. A rubric is

You are allowed to work on these together if you desire but  do turn in your own copy of the completed answers. If you work with others, 
do include the group member names on the paper.  In general, there are no wrong or right answers to many of these questions but do 
show that you put  effort and thoug ht into learning about the spotlighted country and the associated issues . Hopefully , these cases will

still earn an “A” if you miss one assignment due to computer problems, illness, work issues, etc. You are also required to respond in

school /work  event), you must make arrangements with me to take the exam before the scheduled exam date.  Otherwise, only extreme 
emergencies that can be verified  will be accepted as an exc use for missing the exam (in the event of an illness, a note from the doctor 
explicitly indicating that the student should not attend class is mandatory).  In the event of an emergency, it is your respo nsibility to

asked not to register for this course. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/ add period. 
Online exams and quizzes within this course  may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam (USB 
or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is purchase d and 
controlled by the student and that  recordings from any private residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the 
residence. To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University librar y and other 
academic sites at  the University offer secure private settings for recordings, and students with concerns may discuss the location of an 
appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recording s do not invade any third -
party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party privacy concerns. Setup information will 
be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. For additional information about online proctoring you can visit the  online proctoring

Campus Free Expression  (standard USF policy verbiage) : 
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and  
philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve disc ussio n of 
ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you  should 
personally believe. Objective means that the ide a(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the 
idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of  your 
personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding o f the 
ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it . 
 
Policies about access ibility, religious observances, academic grievances, academic misconduct, and several other topics are governed 
by a central set of policies, which apply to all classes at USF: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx  
 
Copyrights:  It is acceptable to tape the lectures and to take notes for personal use, but it is unacceptable to sell them to another pers on 
or to a company that specialize s in the sale of class notes.  
 
Incomplete Grades:  An “I” grade may be given to an undergraduate student only when a small portion of the student’s work (normally 
30% or less) is incomplete due to circumstances beyond the control of the student and only wh en a student is otherwise earning a passing 
grade.  “I” grades are to be used only in emergency situations and cannot to be used as a means of avoiding a poor grade. Nor mally 
these are only for medical emergencies and require a signed letter from a medical  professional that the student was prevented from 
attending class. The student must petition the professor before the week of final exams for a grade of “I” to be given.  
The time limit for removing the “I” is to be set by the instructor of the course. For undergraduate students, this time limit may not exceed 
two academic semesters, whether or not the student is in residence, and/or graduation, whichever comes first.  
 
Course Prerequisite and  Grade Requirements :  Prerequisite course name and number (if any), and any special grade requirements 
regarding passing certain courses with a “C” or better (for some majors); or a “C -“ or better (required for graduation for College of

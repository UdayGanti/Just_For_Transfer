It is important that you remain in good academic standing ( https://catalog.usf.edu/content.php?
catoid=18&navoid=2820#in-good-standing  (https://catalog.usf.edu/content.php?
catoid=18&navoid=2820#in-good-standing) ).  Essentially , this means that you need to maintain an
overall GP A of at least 3.0.
If your GP A drops below 3.0, you are placed on academic probation at the end of the semester in
which your GP A fell below 3.0.  It is important that you address the situation as soon as the next
semester .  If you do not, there is a chance that you will be dismissed from the program.  You also will
not be able to complete an internship.  The process for academic probation is described at

In order to help you get of f academic probation, the School has decided to restrict you to three
courses in the semester after you were placed on academic probation.

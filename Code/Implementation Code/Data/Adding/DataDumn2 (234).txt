Internships
Why is an internship important?

Defined by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) “An internship
               is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in
               the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional
               setting. Internships give students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience
               and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths;
               and give employers the opportunity to guide and evaluate talent.

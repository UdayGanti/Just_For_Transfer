I. Welcome!  
Welcome to ISM 3011!  This may  be another  unusual semester for all of us and I want to assure you that USF and the Muma College of 
Business priorities are the health and well -being of students, faculty,  and staff.  Keeping this in mind, we will be approaching the semester 
armed with data, flexibility,  patience and care.  
 
II. Course Description  
The ISM3011 course material focuses on two fairly distinct content areas.  The first is a survey of the language, concepts, structures,  and 
processes involved in the field of Business Analytics and Info rmation Systems (BAIS), also referred to as Management Information Systems 
(MIS).  The second area involves hands -on projects and explores the use of technology for analytics that support business decisions.  In 
both areas, the course tries to include some  creative and interesting encounters with technology concepts that will be applicable all 
students, regardless of their major. CGS2100 is a prerequisite for this course,  and it is assumed that you are proficient using your laptop 
and Microsoft Excel.  
 
III. Class Format  
ISM 3011 is offered in several different delivery methods:  
• Section 020 & 023 are  100% online.  All assignments and course resources are posted online.  There are no required meetings , 
however, online students are welcome to attend the Thursday nig ht classes (6:30 -8pm in BSN1100 , Tampa Campus  auditorium).  
• Section 021 is a ‘flipped hybrid ’ section.  In this section, the materials are available online and students are expected to spend part of 
what would be class time working through these activities . We’ll meet once a week to discuss the assignments and answer any 
questions you have.  Class meets on  Thursday nights from 6:30 -8pm in BSN 1100 , Tampa Campus  auditorium.   Attendance is not 
required;  however, this is a great opportunity to participate in demos and get  project help.  
 
IV. Course Objectives   
This course is designed for undergraduate business students, as well as anyone else interested in the use of technology withi n 
organizations.  Activit ies are designed to offer  
• an overview of the disciplines within the BAIS / MIS field   
• familiarization with MIS terms, trends,  and new technologies  
• an understanding of how information systems impact all areas of an organization  
• hands -on experiences using technology to aid with analytics and decision making  
 
V. Schedule & Course Topics  – See Class Schedule ( on Canvas  - Canvas Guide ) 
 
VI. Learning Outcomes  
Upon completion of this course students should be able to:  
• identify the disc iplines within BAIS / MIS and the various ways information systems are used within an organization  
• contribute to workplace  discussions about the use of technology to gain competitive advantages  
• describe hardware, software, mobile and network system compone nts 
• use and understand the importance of database and analytical software  
• identify how information systems can be used in process management and systems development  
• discuss current trends in technology, including business intelligence, data mining, and clo ud computing  ISM 3011  SYLLABUS

2 • recognize the importance of the Internet, how it’s used, its role in society and the trends it has enabled (social media)  
• describe technology threats and safeguards  
• discuss the use of technology in the global workforce  
• use technology to provide analytics to support data driven decisions   
 
VII. Course Materials  
Textbook :  This semester we’ll be using the Connect platform.  The idea is to use technology to teach technology, instead of primarily 
readings and lectures. .  
Laptop:  All College of B usiness students are required to own a laptop, please bring yours to on-campus office hours (when available) if 
you need project help.  It’s often impossible  to complete the projects with a Chromebook , so you may want to use USF library computers 
if a Chromebook  is your only device.   
Webcam  / Microphone : Most laptops  come with a webcam, so you can use this or purchase a very inexpensive USB web cam for our final 
project (video required).  Most laptops also include a microphone – you’ll need this as well.   
Optional  Materials:  Any Microsoft  Office text and/or the text from CGS2100 will be helpful if you need to refresh your Excel skills. 
Lynda.com educational videos are also available to all USF students.   I’ll also supply links to online tutorials.  
Software:   We only accept projects done w ith Office software (2016 and more recent). They cannot be done with any other software (no 
Works, Google Docs or OpenOffice).   
• You can get a copy of Microsoft Office 2016 (Windows or Apple) from portal.office.com/home  (sign in with your USF netid; the 
software  is free).  Be sure to install the software on your computer, the online Excel is not a complete version.  
• Mac Users:  
o If you use an Apple version of Office,  be sure to check all of your work on Windows based version of the software before 
uploading to Canvas.  Again, be sure you know how to save your files correctly.  Contact me with questions.  
o MS Access is available via USF’s website: apps.usf.edu.  *** Be sure you check out the instructions on how to save your work 
from apps.usf.edu.  These instruct ions are posted in our FAQ page (Modules area of Canvas)  
Videos:   Numerous video tutorials are posted in our Project Overview pages in the Modules area on Canvas.   Chapter summary videos are  
posted in the Weekly Assignments (Modules area).   
 
All other materials will be posted on Canvas.  The TAs and I offer many online office hours  via Teams .  We also offer email support  (Note 
that TAs do not respond to email or assignment comments ).   Take advantage of any or all these contact opportunities.  We are trying to 
provide all the tools for success in this class, but you are ultimately responsible for your own learning experience.

• Final grades are not rounded up unless the course average is less than 75%.  
• NOTE: Undergraduate students who enter USF under the 2001 -2002, or later, catalog are required to earn a 
grade of C - or better, in every undergraduate core class and an overall GPA of 2.0 for all undergraduate core 
classes.  
 3 IX. Assignment Details  
• Syllabus Qui z:  This is a brief quiz on Canvas  to encourage you to review the syllabus, schedule, FAQ page, and our course materials 
on Canvas.  You can take this once.   
• Each Week:   I’ll post announcements on the home page and send an email announcement reminding you  of upcoming activities.  In 
the Modules area of our Canvas class,  you’ll also find links detailing each week’s activities.   
• Weekly ‘Check -in’ Quizzes  – These are quick, low point quizzes to cover common questions and help us all stay engaged.  
• Connect Activities: The schedule details the topics we’ll be covering using the online Connect activities.   The Connect activities allow 
you to learn about tech nology by using technology.  They are varied formats to cover concepts important to technology in 
organizations. Connect activities include:  
o Readings  – these do not earn any points, but help you prepare for the Assessments.  
o Adaptive Learning Activities  – these help you cover the concepts and can be used to supplement or replace the readings.  I 
cannot set late dates for these activities (it’s a Connect system issue), so please complete these before the ir due date s. 
o Application Based Activities – these help you review concepts in a more hands -on manner.  They are not required and do not 
earn any points.  
o Case studies: Case studies cover the concepts as used in industry.  Some are written, some are videos.  They can be submitted 
after the due date  with the 5% off per day late penalty.  
o Assessments:  These are short quizzes, most are 20 questions, 40 minutes.   You can submit these assessments after the due date  
with the penalty of 5% off per day late.    
• Projects : This class has considerable  hands -on / project assignments.  Most times you’ll do a quick tutorial  project first for 10 points, 
then apply the skills to a second 100 -point project  and finish up with a shorter project (40 points) of your choosing, demonstrating the 
skills learned . The 10 -point projects teach all the skills necessary for the other required projects.  If you come for TA or instructor help 
on a 100 -point or 40 -point project, we’ll ask to first see your completed corresponding 10 -point project.   Projects are submitted via 
Canva s.  (HTML projects must also be submitted to the USF server).    Projects can be submitted late to Canvas with the 5% penalty 
per day late penalty , up to 2 weeks late.  
• Ending  Survey Activity  – This is a quick survey about the course.  It is different from the Oasis course evaluation.  This asks you free 
response questions, so I can read your comments and make improvements.  I wait until all grades are posted and remove  all 
identifiers before reading the responses.  
 
X. Covid -19 Procedures  
As Covid policies are quite fluid, please check with the USF website for the latest recommendations.  
 
Additional details are available on the University ’s Core Syllabus Policy Statements page : https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core -
syllabus -policy -statements.aspx  
 
XI. Course Policies:  
• Office Hours : MS Teams will be used for all office  hours an d links to these sessions will be on the Canvas home page.   It will be up to 
students to attend office hours as needed in order to ensure a successful learning experience.  
• Due dates / times – Late dates / times :  Canvas is the official clock for turning in work – and the due date time is 11:59:00pm Eastern 
Standard Time (not 11:59:59pm).  Don’t wait until the last hour  to submit work  – as it may take some time  to complete your 
submission,  or your clocks and the Canvas clock may not be synchronized.  Late work penalties can be adjusted if  notification is sent 
before the due date.  A local doctor’s note is also required, excusing you from work and school during the whole assignment time.   If 
a project has several parts, if one part is submitted late – the whole project is considered late   
• When work is submitted late, it may receive a zero grade  until the assignment is reviewed and graded.  This is a Canvas feature.  
• Support :  The TAs and I are available for project help during the week.  I am also available for project help via email  (not the TAs) , 
although weekend email support is limited  and it’s often harder to adequately respond to project questions via email .  Start early 
enough to beat the ‘due date rush’ and so that if the TAs can’t answer your question, you’ll have time to contact your professor .  TAs 
help with projects, if you have other course questions, please contact your professor . 
• Submitting Projects:   
o Check your project u ploads - Required : To do this, look at the submission information on the right side of your screen and 1) 
download  a copy a copy of your project files FROM Canvas to another folder on your computer.  2) Open these files, be sure 
they’re complete, the right project, etc.  and then 3) save these copies. These are your back up copies and the creation and last 
modified dates will be retained as long the projects are not opened again.   
o As a reminder, many semesters there are 500 -700+ students in the various sections, and we spend a lot of time grading.  In an 
effort to get your grades to you as soon as possible, we’ll start reviewing projects as we see them submitted to Canvas.  Ple ase 
don’t submit your project unless you are ready  for us to grade it.  Please check your all uploads to be sure the right project files 
have  uploaded correctly.    4 o Work submitted to Canvas incorrectly that cannot be opened or graded for any reason is considered late and may or may not be 
accepted later.  Again, c heck your upload to avoid this.  
o Work that is submitted to the wrong assignment on Canvas is also considered late (late penalty applied) and will only be acce pted 
if submitted before the due date (or late date, if there is one).  One more time, c heck your uploads to avoid this.  
o If you use an Apple version of software, you’ll have to check all your work on Windows based version of the software before 
uploading to Canvas.  Windows computers are available at the USF library.  
o No work is accepte d via email.  Projects must be submitted via Canvas.  
o Each set of projects takes up to 2 weeks to grade.  This process is not automated; we open each project and grade it. Typical ly, 
during the fall and spring semesters there are 600-800+ students in the s ections of the class.   Please be patient while we review 
work & post grades.  Late projects / bad uploads are  usually graded after this period.  
o Once a project is graded, it can’t be resubmitted / re -graded.  
• Submitting Other Assignments:  
o As with all transa ctions over the Internet, it’s always a good idea to keep a copy documenting what you’ve done!   
o Check your quiz scores when you’ve completed them.   You can even take a screen shot of submissions or of the screen showing 
your score and save it to a folder  of ‘screenshots.’  Just be sure your log -in information and date / time is also included in the 
screenshot.  
• Your Grades : 
o We know grades are important and try to be very attentive while grading and recording grades.   Please do your part by keepin g 
copies of all submitted work, monitoring your own grades and keeping all graded correspondence/returned work.  
o Canvas has a ‘ what if’  feature that lets you look at your grade, enter grades you think you may get in the future and see where 
you stand.  Take advanta ge of this.  
o Re-grade  requests should be emailed within two weeks from the date your grade was posted  and before the end of the semester.  
To do this, download and review a copy of your submitted project from Canvas and then email  me (not Tas)  with a description of 
what was graded incorrectly and why it’s incorrect.  We will do a re -grade but will re -grade the whole project and any grading 
mistakes or omissions (positive or negative) will be corrected.   
o ‘Technology problems’ , including bad files, bad file names, not knowing how to upload to Canvas correctly (not checking an 
upload), locked files, lost work, slow or bad Internet connection, power outages at your home, etc. are not valid excuses for  
late/missing work – they are just  part of using technology .  Ask questions, get help, do your work early and check that 
assignments are submitted correctly so the inevitable technology problems will not lead to missed points.  We offer many cont act 
hours each week to help you with this.  
o Medical Issues - From  USF Student Health Services:   ‘Students should not attend class if they are ill, particularly if they have fever 
and/or gastrointestinal symptoms and/or respiratory symptoms such as a sneezing, runny nose, sore throat or coughing.  
Students experiencing any of these symptoms should contact immediately the Student Health Services (813 -974-2331) on the 
Sarasota -Mantatee and Tampa campus or the Wellness Center (727 -873-4422) on the St. Petersburg campus for appropriate 
medica l guidance and to obtain a verification of care letter. Students may turn to other health providers as well. ’ To be approved 
for missed classes, late assignments or missed examinations a verification of care letter from USF health services or area 
physicia n must be presented by the student to the faculty near the start (within a week) of any illness or condition that 
prevents class participation.  
• Extra Credit  is usually  available during the semester.  Any extra points will help if you are ‘close’ to the ne xt grade level and usually the 
place of any curve or any ‘rounding’ in the class.  Activities will be descr ibed  on Canvas.  Any integrity violations involving extra credit 
will result in the loss of all extra credit points.    
• Canvas  - All class announc ements and class materials are on Canvas.  CHECK it FREQUENTLY  (Canvas is your friend…)   To use Canvas 
you must go to my.usf.edu and sign in using your USF NetID and Password.  If you are a new user or have forgotten your passwo rd, 
instructions/links are a vailable from my.usf.edu to help you.  Once you are signed in, click the Canvas tab and find our class and 
familiarize yourself with the course website . If you have any issues, contact USF's IT department at it.usf.edu/help,  (813) 974 -1222 or 
help@usf.edu . 
• Email to me should be sent  to your instructo r via Canvas or your USF email account .  Email is usually answered within 24 -48 hours 
(not including weekends/holidays).  
• Email from instructors is usually sent via Canvas, which is tied to your university/student email account.  It is your responsibility to 
change your USF email ‘preferences’ if you want to forward email to a different account.   This can be done through Canv as. You can 
also set up your Canvas preferences to notify you when any announcements are posted.  Be sure to check your JUNK/SPAM folders  
for all class related email that may be inadvertently filtered  
• MS Teams:  We’ll be using Teams software for some office  hours and if any sessions are recorded, student interactions may be heard 
in the captured content.   Any r ecorded sessions will be posted on Canvas, as appropriate.  
• End of Semester Student Evaluations:   All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide feedback to the 
University regarding the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of the semester, and the University will not ify you by 
email when the response window  opens. Your participation is highly encouraged and valued.  5  
• Academic Integrity - Integrity does matter  
Please review:  http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/AcademicIntegrityOfStudents. pdf) 
o We value learning and realize that technology allows work to be copied easily so we have a strict academic integrity policy.   As 
part of that, we require that all projects be done individually (unless specifically noted) .  We have found that more individual 
learning occurs when students use critical thinking, problem solving skills, course / online resources and a bit of trial and  error to 
work through these projects.   The TAs and I are available for project help. To facilitate learning we try to guide you to find your 
own solutions, rather than just tell you an answer .    
o **Do not email your work to anyone else to use as a ‘sample’, or as a copy of the data or share in any way .  Do not deny them 
the opportunity to experiment and learn potentially valuable career skills.  Also, we use software to detect duplicated work.    It is 
your responsibility  to be sure your project cannot be copied or viewed by anyone else.  
o If you share a  computer with another person (not recommended) or use a public computer, remove any project work to a flash 
drive each time you are done working on the project .  
o Quizzes are completed online and again, are individual activities.  All work must be complete ly your own - no copying, pasting, 
quotes – just your own words/efforts.   
o Course Hero / Chegg Policy:  Offer specifics about your policy on contract cheating, paper mills, or the use of websites that enable 
cheating.  Example: The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may not use websites that enable cheating, such 
as by uploading or downloading material for this p urpose. This does apply specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – any 
use of these websites (including uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy.  
o Turnitin.com:  In this course, turnitin.com will be utili zed. Turnitin is an automated system which instructors may use to quickly 
and easily compare each student's assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous database of student papers th at 
grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be e xpected to submit specific assignments via the appropriate Canvas / 
TurnItIn assignment. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a report from turnitin.com that states if and  how 
another author’s work was used in the assignment. For a mo re detailed look at this process visit http://www.turnitin.com .  
 
All that being said… copying, plagiarism or any other form of misrepresentation of one's work is considered cheating - this 
includes cutting/pasting from the Internet or copying anyone else’s projects/ assignments or  sharing solutions in any way. 
This applies to all course assignments. The minimum penalty for collaboration/cheating on an assignment is a zero for 
that assi gnment  and a referral to the Undergraduate Studies Director and Muma College of Business Undergraduate 
Program Director .  This is applied to all parties involved.  Maximum penalties may include an F or F/F in the course 
(instructor’s discretion).  Students who have been referred for an academic integrity violation in a prior class will be 
subject to an F/F in this class in accordance with USF’s ac ademic integrity policies and after discussions with pertinent 
faculty members, and Muma College of Business Undergraduate Advising.  
o College of Business policies do not allow students to drop classes due to academic integrity violations.  Students will be added 
back into classes in these situations.  
 
I do not enjoy the ‘academic dishonesty’ part of teaching – it is emotional for all & takes A LOT of time to deal with.  However, 
I do feel very strongly about honesty/integrity and I do uphold University/my c ourse policies on cheating.  One survey of IT 
professionals found that the key attribute they looked for in new hires was integrity (above technical skills). I treat acade mic 
dishonesty very  seriously and will fail students who cheat on tests or turn in wo rk that is not completely their own.  See 
“Academic Dishonesty” in the Undergraduate Catalog for further discussion.   
 
If you have questions on academic integrity issues relating individual assignments or tests – please contact me, I’ll be glad to 
discuss this in more detail.   
 
XII. Additional USF Policies / Resources  
• Standard University Policies.  Policies about disability ac cess, religious observances, academic grievances, academic integrity and 
misconduct, academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual harassment are governed by a central set of policies that apply to all 
classes at USF. These may be accessed at: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx   
• Emergency Operations: In the event of an emergency, it may be necessa ry for USF to suspend normal operations.  It’s the 
responsibility of each student to monitor our Canvas site for each class for course specific communication, and the main USF,  College, 
and department websites, emails, and MoBull messages for important gen eral information.  
• Incomplete Policy: An ‘I’ grade may be used for situations where a student has an unforeseeable emergency at the end of the 
semester (after the withdrawal date), has a C grade or better in the class and only has a small part of the cours e to complete.  Written 
approved documentation is required.   Incompletes can’t be used if a student is busy, falls behind or is not doing well.  Stu dents doing 
poorly in a course should withdraw from the class or risk receiving a poor/failing grade.  See o ur schedule for the last day to 
withdraw from the class.  6 • Religious Holy Days : Students who must miss a scheduled test due to the observation of a major religious observance must provide 
notice of the date(s) to the instructor, in writing, during the first  2 weeks of class. http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/ReligiousDays.pdf  
• Students with Disabilities : Students in need of academic accommodations for a disability may consult with the office of Students with 
Disabilities Services to arrange appropriate accommodations. Students are required to give reasonable notice prior to requesting an 
accommodation.  
• Disruption of the Academic Process - http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/DisruptionOfAcademicProcess.pdf  
• Use of notes and recordings:   Please review the official USF policy on this for more info, but the policy states that notes, recordings, 
handouts and other material provided by the instructor cannot be exchanged or distributed for commercia l purposes or for any 
purpose not related to a student's study or enrollment without written authorization of the instructor.  
• Tutoring Hub  -  For more information, email asctampa@usf.edu  
• Writing Studio  - For more information or to make an appointment, email writingstudio@usf.edu   
• Counseling Center  - The Counseling Center promotes the wellbeing of the campus community by providing culturally sensitive 
counseling, consultation, prevention, and training that enhances student academic and personal s uccess. Contact information is 
available online .  
• Center for V ictim Advocacy   - Example:  The Center for Victim Advocacy empowers survivors of crime, violence, or abuse by promoting 
the restoration of decision making, by advocating for their rights, and by offering support and resources. Contact informatio n is 
available online .  
• Class and Online Courtesy – Please review the ‘Getting Started’ section of Canvas and note the two sections: 1) “What Can You Expect 
From the TAs and Me”  and 2) “What the TAs and I Expect from You”.   
• Campus  Free Expression: It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent 
ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and criticall y evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may 
involve discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you  should 
personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, a nd that the 
idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your 
personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the 
ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.  
 
XIII. How to Succeed in this Course  
• Get started right away!   If new to Canvas, read Canvas Guide  
o Review the syllabus and Canvas material.  Be sure you understand how t he class works.   
o Get access to the Connect platform as the first assignments are due soon .  See our class Home page on Canvas for more on this.  
o Note our Office hours - via a link on our Canvas home page.    
• Keep up with the class .  Each week:  
o Read our Can vas Home page and modules area each week to keep up with class information, project due dates, any extra credit 
opportunities, etc.  
o Complete the Connect activities for each week.   Connect activities CANNOT be submitted late.  
o Work on the assigned projects,  don’t procrastinate on these.  
o Note all due dates.  
• Turn in your projects on -time .   
o Project information and resources are in the Assignment area of Canvas.  
o Use the Project Overview link found on each assignment page. The overview and any skill links includ ed demonstrate skills you 
will use to complete the projects. There are also some basic tutorial site links available in the FAQ section.  
o Start early, get help when needed.   Give yourself enough time so that if a TA or USF IT support can’t answer a questio n, you still 
have time to contact me and get help before the due date.  If I can’t resolve the issue, your project won’t be considered lat e.  If 
you wait until the last minute and have issues, I probably won’t be able to get to your questions before the du e date and your 
work will be considered late.  
o Projects are due on every other week, but it is recommended that you complete them as early as possible so you can get help, if 
necessary, before the due date.  
• Upload your projects to Canvas AND check your up loads!  
o Be sure to submit and check your work early so you have time to get any issues resolved before the due date.  Remember, there  
is no scheduled weekend support.  
o After you submit your project, CHECK YOUR UPLOAD to be sure it was uploaded correctly on C anvas. See instructions above in the 
‘Course Details’ section.  7 o If your project doesn’t upload correctly, you can resubmit it.  To do this, go back to the upload link and submit the project  file.  
Then check your upload again.  We only grade the last project submitted. If you are submitting several files for an assignm ent – 
resubmit all of them.   
o Once your project has been graded, it can’t be corrected and / or resubmitted.  Don’t submit work unless you are ready for it  to 
be graded.  
• Do any extra credit activities available .  Any extra credit points may take the place of any curve or any ‘rounding’ in the class.  
• Keep track of your grades on Canvas .  Note that any grayed -out grades are considered ‘drop’ grades by Canvas (drop grades are not 
available every semester).  If you use the what -if feature, where you enter your grades to see your final average, be sure  to enter 
zeros for any work not submitted.   
• Suggestions for quiz  preparation  
o Keep up with the work – don’t wait until the week of the test to go over all the material.  
o Take notes as you do the readings and review the page for each chapter.

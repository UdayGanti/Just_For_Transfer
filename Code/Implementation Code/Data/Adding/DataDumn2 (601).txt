StormReady

USF Tampa is proud to announce that we have successfully renewed our recognition as
               a leader in severe weather preparedness through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
               Administration's (NOAA) StormReady University program. The program signifies USF's
               commitment to safety by maintaining established plans, programs, training, and notification
               systems to enhance preparedness and response to severe weather events.
"StormReady communities are better prepared to save lives from the onslaught of severe
               weather through advanced planning, education and awareness" said Daniel Noah, Warning
               Coordination Meteorologist with the National Weather Service - Tampa Bay Area. "No
               community is storm proof, but StormReady can help communities save lives."
The University will notify the community of tornado warnings affecting its campuses
               through AlertUSF. USF students, faculty, and staff can sign-up forÂ AlertUSF text messages and other public safety applications.
The StormReady certification is valid for a period of three years; USF will reapply
               to the program again in 2021.

Career Coaching
What is career coaching? Is it for me?
Wherever you are on your career path, you might benefit from coaching. Some people
               engage with a coach without knowing where to start or what to ask. Others have a strong
               sense of their goals and need a sounding board. Some clients are well on their way,
               and maybe want a one-time mock interview.
Career coaching is not personal counseling. Although it may be difficult to separate
               life issues from career issues, typically career coaching is focused on topics related
               to career development and job transition.

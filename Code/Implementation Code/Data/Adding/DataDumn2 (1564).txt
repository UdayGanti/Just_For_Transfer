Overview

The purpose of business and community engagement is the partnership of college and
               university knowledge and resources with those of the public and private sectors to
               enrich scholarship, research, and creative activity; enhance curriculum, teaching
               and learning; prepare educated, engaged citizens; strengthen democratic values and
               civic responsibility; address critical societal issues; and contribute to the public
               good.

Internships, a key component of curriculum, is an integral part of business and community
               engagement. Having student interns creates a true reciprocity whereby the employer
               benefits as well as the student. Many employers use internship programs to identify
               and review potential future employees.

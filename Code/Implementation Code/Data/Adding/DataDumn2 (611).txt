Strategic Plan

The 2020-2023 Emergency Management Program Strategic Plan was developed to outline strategic goals and objectives to support the mission of
               the program. The plan was written to align with the University of South Florida's
               2013-2018 Strategic Plan to ensure continuity with University goals and objectives.

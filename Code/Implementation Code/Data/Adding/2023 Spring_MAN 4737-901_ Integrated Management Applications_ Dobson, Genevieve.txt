Spring 20 23  USF  SYSTEM  POLICIES  
 
USF has a set of central  policies  related  to student recording class  sessions,  academic integrity 
and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, religious observances, 
academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual  harassment  that apply  to all courses  at USF . 
These can be found online at usf.edu/provost/faculty- success/resources -policies -forms/core - 
syllabus -policy- statements.aspx  
 
Campus  Free Expression:  
 
It is fundamental  to the University  of South Florida’s  mission  to support an environment where 
divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. 
Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas  that you find 
uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive. 
 
In the instructional setting,  ideas  are intended  to be presented  in an objective manner and not as 
an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) 
presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research. 
 
Not all ideas  can be supported by objective methods or criteria.  Regardless,  you may decide that 
certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it. 4 MAN  4737  Integrated  Management  Applications

XIII. Course Policies: Student Expectations   
 
Title IX Policy :  
Title IX provides federal protections for discrimination based on sex, which includes 
discrimination based on pregnancy, sexual harassment, and interpersonal violence. In an 
effort to provide support and equal access, USF has designated all faculty (TA, Adjunct, etc.) 
as Responsible Employees, who are required to report any disclosures of sexual harassment, 
sexual violence, relationship violence or stalking.  The Title IX Office makes every effort, when 
safe to do so, to reach out and provide resources and accommodations, and to discuss 
possible options for resolution.   Anyone wishing to make a Title IX report or seeking 
accommodations may do so online, in person, via phone, or email to the Title IX Office. For 
information about Title IX or for a full list of resources please visit:  https://www.usf.edu/title -
ix/gethelp/resources.aspx . I f you are unsure what to do, please contact Victim Advocacy – a 
confidential resource that can review all your options – at 813 -974-5756 or  va@admin.usf.edu . 
 
Course Hero  / Chegg  Policy:  
The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may not use websites that enable 
cheating, such as by uploading or downloadi ng material for this purpose. This does apply 
specifically to Chegg.com and CourseHero.com – almost a ny use of th ese websites (including 
uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy .  
Professionalism Policy:  
Per university policy and classroom etiquette, mobile phones, iPods, etc. must be silenced 
during all classroom and lab lectures. Those not heeding this rule will be asked to leave the  
 
5 classroom/lab immediately so as to not disrupt  the learning environment. Please arrive on 
time for all class meetings. Students who habitually disturb the class by talking, arriving late, 
etc., and have been warned may suffer a reduction in their final class grade.  
 
Students are expected to adhere to  the overall class calendar and to complete work or 
assignments by the due dates posted in Canvas. It will be difficult to perform at a high level if 
you do not regularly attend discussion group meetings and actively participate. If you need to miss a grou p meeting, please send a communication to you team with a copy to the professor 
in advance. If you will be late with a submission, it’s  always good to let your professor know in 
advance.  
   
Netiquette Guidelines  
1. Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers with respect, the same way you would do in a face -to-face environment. Respect other people’s ideas and 
be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not agre e with.   
2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. There will be people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and religious beliefs or other general differences.   
3. Proofread and check sp elling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a thread on a 
discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, and it is more difficult to read.  
4. Keep your communications focused and stay on topic. Complete your ideas before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to easily get your idea or 
answers they are looking for.  
5. Be clear with your messag e. Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can’t see your 
expressions or hear your tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.

In the spring of 2021, three power players in the Tampa Bay business community joined
               together to educate business and community leaders on the essential practices and
               tools designed to increase employee diversity and to create a sustainable business
               model that embraces equity and inclusion.  The USF Muma College of Business offered
               – free of charge – a “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Workplace” certificate,
               sponsored by the Tampa Bay Lightning and Jabil, to help corporate leaders navigate
               this journey.  More than 135,000 people signed up for the program and after seven
               weeks of weekly online lessons, more than 63,000 people earned the Credly certificate
               and badge.
In the fall, the program will be offered a second time, with pre-recorded content
               from the first session, allowing a new group of business and community leaders a chance
               to participate in this timely, relevant and important training session.  The content
               will be made available free of charge but there will be a modest fee for the certificate
               and badge.

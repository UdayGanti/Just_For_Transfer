The University of South Florida Muma College of Business does more than simply disseminate
               knowledge. Our business school is shaping business thinkers and equipping students
               with the skills and knowledge to take leading positions in business and society.
Yes, we teach business, but we do so much more than simply instruct students. We create
               business thinkers by challenging students with rigorous curriculum that is taught
               by faculty who practice what they teach. We provide meaningful learning opportunities
               and deliver relevant knowledge to our students so that they can see how it connects
               with their lives.
We build smaller communities so that students can enjoy all the advantages of attending
               a large metropolitan university while experiencing what it is like to be a part of
               a small group of people with similar interests, similar goals, similar dreams.
As ongoing scholars, we create intellectual capital through active research and interaction
               with area companies. We collaborate with employers to produce graduates they want
               to hire.
We have achieved great things since the first USF business degree was conferred in
               1963. We have proven ourselves to be among the best business schools with our dual
               AACSB accreditation. We are proud of our accomplishments, but, true to our entrepreneurial
               spirit, we look forward to what is to come. We are transforming minds and transforming
               students into future alumni who will lead businesses, spearhead initiatives, and be
               a powerful force in the community.

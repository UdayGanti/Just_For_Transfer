Course Description:
As organizations gather and access more and more data, the issue of knowledge management in general
and business intelligence and data analytics in particular takes on an increasing importance for
organizational success.  The importance of data for organizational success obviously raises the question
how to manage the data.  
This course examines a myriad of questions related to this, including
How do you decide which data to store in the first place?
What is the best way to store the data?
How can you retrieve data from the data store?
How do you secure data?5/14/23, 8:16 AM Syllabus for ISM6218.360U23.50246 Advanced Database Management
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1806132/assignments/syllabus 2/8Course Objectives:
At the conclusion of this course, students are expected to be able to:
1. Describe the widely used relational database model.
2. Write queries using SQL.
3. Design and document database systems using entity-relationship diagram (ERD) tools.
4. Implement database systems using SQL  data definition statements and integrity constraints.
5. Apply various techniques such as index structures and optimization modes to improve query
performance.
6. Contrast a variety of alternative (NoSQL) database models with the relational model with regards to
workload fit.
7. Create and query a NoSQL  database
Course Material
Required:
NONE
We will of course rely heavily on Canvas.  The Canvas privacy policy is
at https://www .canvaslms.com/policies/privacy  (https://www.canvaslms.com/policies/privacy) .
NOTE: The course is designed for a Windows platform.  If you are a Mac user , let me know as soon as
possible because we have set up an alternative in the form of a V irtual Desktop.  It will take a few days for
you to get access to the VM.
Grading:
You will be assessed through a number of group and individual assignments, as well as a reflective essay
on what you learned in the course and how you could use the competencies acquired in the course in your
professional career .
In general, the individual assignments will be relatively structured and will typically have a single right
answer .  The group assignments, on the other hand, will be less structured and will require some
discussion among the group members.  Also, there will be in general be more than one right answer .
 Groups will consist of 4 to 6 group members, and I will ask you to assess individually assess the
participation of the group members in each project.  Your individual grade will then be determined based on
the grade of the group assignment and the contribution you made to the group project.
The inclusion for a reflective essay may need some justification. Research (see e.g.
http://www .cmu.edu/teaching/principles/learning.html
(http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/principles/learning.html) ) has shown that learning improves considerably ,
especially for adult students, if students reflect on their learning and how they could use the competencies
and knowledge that they acquired in a course through their own careers. There will be more details on what
to include in the essay later on in the course.5/14/23, 8:16 AM Syllabus for ISM6218.360U23.50246 Advanced Database Management

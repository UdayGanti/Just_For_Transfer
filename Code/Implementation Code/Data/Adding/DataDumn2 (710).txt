Overview
What is the Bulls Business Network (BBN)?
The Bulls Business Network, an organization for high-achieving first-year students,
               provides an avenue for aspiring business students to enjoy early admission to the
               business program, provides special registration and advising opportunities, and promotes
               events and activities designed to help build a small community within the larger USF
               family.
Benefits of the Bulls Business Network
Select freshman are accepted directly into the Muma College of Business based on their
               high school GPA and SAT or ACT test scores, while the majority of students are not
               fully admitted to the college of business until after they complete their first two
               years of general course requirements. BBN students take the same classes as their
               non-BBN peers, but enjoy several benefits as a result of the BBN membership:

Muma living-learning communities - living-learning experienceBBN members are eligible for the Bulls Business Community or the Zimmerman Advertising Program, two residential programs where students can live with their peers who are not only
                  in similar classes, but have commons goals and interests.
Registration perksBBN students have an opportunity to avoid mass lecture classes. Smaller sections of
                  business classes are reserved exclusively for BBN members each semester.
AccessStudents in the BBN may apply for special Muma scholarships and may join business
                  student organizations normally open only to juniors and seniors.
Business Honors ProgramMembers of the BBC or ZAP living-learning communities can also apply to be a part
                  of the highly selective Business Honors program. This prestigious program inspires
                  passion and nurtures exemplary potential in students by blending rigorous coursework
                  and research activities with special residential, service, international, and applied
                  learning opportunities found inside and outside of the classroom.

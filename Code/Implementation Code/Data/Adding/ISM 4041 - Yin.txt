GenEd Assignment #1: Ethical Lens Inventory (ELI) and Professional Ethics Essay. Complete the online ELI survey and write a Professional Ethics Essay that translates your core values into specific behaviors you will follow in your professional life. The ELI is 36-question instruments that will help you identify your preferred ethical perspective and reflect on how your personal core values influence your decisions. The ELI will also introduce you to The Four Ethical Lenses™, four perspectives for analyzing ethical dilemmas. Assignment will be graded for both content and writing (e.g., grammar).  1) Complete the Ethical Lens Inventory (ELI). Download and attach a copy of your results. 2) Write your Professional Ethics Statement which should be completed after reflection on your ELI results. Reflect on the dilemmas you may be faced with in your professional life and assess what are the most important values to you in your professional life. Create a professional ethics statement to guide your professional life. 3) Defend your statement. After you write your professional ethics statement, look back at the information about your primary/preferred lens:  a. Write a short statement of how well the professional ethics statement reflects the core values of your primary/preferred lens and areas of growth for that lens.  b. Include a discussion how you might best deal with your blind spot. 4) Compare and contrast your ethical lens perspective with at least one other lens and how you might respect those differences.  2. Global Citizen Assignment - Ethics Simulations (2).  You will complete two virtual simulations that challenge you to make decisions from multiple ethical perspectives on global cyber ethical dilemmas. Each simulation is an immersive, interactive and iterative learning tool where you practice making decisions. The simulations will teach you how to analyze problems from multiple perspectives and deepen your knowledge of The Four Ethical Lenses. Each dilemma will take about forty-five minutes to complete and is in the form of multiple-choice questions. As you go along, you will receive feedback as to why your answers are correct or not from a specific ethical perspective.  3. GenEd Assignment #2: Corporate Ethics Assessment.  Using the insights from the lectures, case discussions, personal and professional ethics statements as a foundation, this assignment asks you to reflect on the ethical posture of a multinational corporation. You will research a multinational company and investigate its ethical policies and practices. These polices can normally be found using a Google search. The assignment will be graded for both content and writing (e.g., grammar).   1) Include Professional Ethics Statement, revised based on instructor feedback. 2) Choose a multinational corporation. Linkable list of multinational corporations: Link a. Include a link to the corporate ethics policy page.  b. Write a summary of the most salient ethical policies of the corporation. Paraphrase in your own words. 3) Evaluate and describe how this corporation’s ethical policies, values, and perspectives addresses cultural and legal issues that may vary across nations or cultural groups. 4) Compare how this corporation’s ethical policies, values, and perspectives differ or are similar to your Professional Ethics Statement. Based on this comparison would you be a good fit to work for this company? Why or why not?     4 4. Quizzes (10).  There will be 10 quizzes in this course. Quizzes cover everything discussed in class, including case presentations and assigned readings. There are no make-ups for the quizzes, unless being excused in advance. After each quiz, if you have any questions or disagreements about your quiz grading, you must submit your questions/appeals in writing (through the online form on top of Canvas) to the instructor.  5. Attendance.  Your classroom attendance is expected in every session unless being excused. • There will be 10 random attendance checks throughout the semester. Each check can occur at any time unprompted during a class session, and you need to be present physically at that time. After the attendance check sheet was returned to the instructor after circulation, attendance check for that class would be completed. o If you missed a check (e.g., because you came in late or left early with no legitimate reason reported in advance), then you’d be marked as “absent” even though you were present at some other times. • In order for your absence to be excused, you need to request it (submitting the online form on top of Canvas) in advance at least 2 hours before the class starts, and upload proof that the absence is beyond your control (e.g., being sick, an accident, an interview) and cannot be avoided (e.g., can’t schedule a job interview at other times). If it’s emergency, then you should submit your request as soon as you can (even during a class session). o Medical Excuses: You should not attend class if you are ill, particularly if you have fever and/or gastrointestinal symptoms and/or respiratory symptoms such as a sneezing, runny nose, sore throat or coughing. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should contact Student Health Services immediately (813-974-2331) for appropriate medical guidance and to obtain a verification of care letter. To be approved for missed classes, missed quizzes or late assignments, you must submit a verification of care letter electronically or upon return to class. • If you were absent for 3 consecutive weeks (for any reason), your final grade would be F. The only exception is unforeseeable circumstances that last for 3 or more weeks. o If you expect this to happen, you are strongly advised to not take this course.  6. Group Contributions: Case Study (Video) Presentations (2).  You will form your group (3-4 students in each group) during the first week. Each group will create video presentations of two cases from the textbook over the course of the semester. The cases will serve as a framework/benchmark to help inform and determine a strategy for your thought process and growth in the understanding of cyber ethics. Each group also has the OPTION of providing a case study on a topic of choice (must be approved by instructor). Said topic must be current hot topic in cyber ethics. • For each case, your group will be expected to prepare a 10-minute presentation on your assigned or chosen topic. In the presentation, you must: o Identify all your group members (with faces shown and names pronounced) and the case name. o Give a brief overview of the case – paraphrase and use your own words. No points for just reading (any portion of) the case.     5 o Research the case topic and provide updated and/or supplementary material. o Articulate the ethical dilemma(s) in the form of a question(s). State and defend your position on the dilemma. o Discuss the questions following the case. • Submit your group’s completed video on Canvas by 10am of the Wednesday during the week in which the associated chapter is to be discussed.  7. Group Member Peer Evaluation.  In the final week, each student will submit a confidential evaluation of the other members of his or her group. Be candid and honest in your assessments.  8. Video Case Peer Evaluations.  You will be expected to evaluate two case video presentations each week on Canvas. These evaluations are due 5pm on Thursday.   Policies  Standard University Policies.  Policies about disability access, religious observances, academic grievances, academic integrity and misconduct, academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual harassment are governed by a central set of policies that apply to all classes at USF. These may be accessed at: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspx • Academic Honesty: Students in this class are required to abide by the academic regulations of the university. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. Violations of academic integrity, including but not limited to plagiarism and cheating (in any manner, online or offline), are regarded as extremely serious matters and will be addressed to the fullest extent allowed by university regulations.  Class Etiquette.  The goal of class is to facilitate learning. No manner of behavior that is detrimental to learning will be tolerated.   • Arrive at class on time and do not leave early. o If you have to miss a class or arrive late or leave early but want to be excused, you need to request it in advance and upload proof (see pt. 5 in the prior page). • All electronic devices (e.g., laptop, tablet, cell phone, etc.) are prohibited during the class time to ensure a positive learning environment for all students. o Cell phones should be silenced (or turned off) and placed outside of your (and the instructor’s) view. Violation of this policy may result in your device being moved to the front desk, which can be retrieved later after the class is over. o Laptop computers are necessary in only a few particular classes. In that case, notification emails will be sent to you in advance as a reminder. o If you absolutely have to use a laptop/tablet for notetaking purposes, you need to hand-write and submit a contract agreeing that you will abide by the following conditions in order to use a laptop/tablet during classes: a) you are using the device for the sole purpose of notetaking and not for any other purposes, b) you will sit in the side row (close to wall or window) or last row to avoid distracting     6 other students (exception: using tablet without propping it up), c) the contract will be terminated immediately if you are ever found out to do something else other than notetaking on your device during class times. This contract needs to be signed by both you and the instructor. • Do not hold side discussions. If you have a question or want to present your opinion about an issue under scrutiny, raise your hand and say it loud enough for the class to hear. Do not chat with your neighbor during our class time. • When you want to engage in a class discussion, raise your hand and wait for your turn.  Late Quizzes/Assignments.  There are no make-ups for the quizzes and assignments. Late submissions, unless being excused in advance (before due time), will be given HALF credit.  Re-grade Policy.  All graded material may be requested for re-evaluation of the grade by the instructor. To request a re-grade, you must submit an online request form (on top of Canvas) within one week of the date the quiz or assignment was returned. The request must explain (a) the specific test questions or aspects of the assignment that you want re-evaluated; and (b) WHY the original grade is in error and should be reconsidered.  Communication.  Canvas will be used extensively for announcements, grades, slides, and other materials. It is your responsibility to check it on a regular basis. To communicate with the instructor, please also do so on Canvas.  Campus Free Expression.  It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.   In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research.   Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.        7 Course Calendar (tentative)  Week Date Reading Discussion Topic Cases 1 8/21 Syllabus Syllabus Review  8/23  Course Introduction  2 8/28 Ch. 1 An Overview of Ethics  8/30 Ch. 1 An Overview of Ethics Case 1: VW Cheats on Emissions Testing 3 9/4  Labor Day – No Class  9/6 Ch. 1 An Overview of Ethics Case 2: Toshiba Accounting Scandal 4 9/11 Ch. 2 Ethics for IT Workers and IT Users Case 3: Bridgestone versus IBM 9/13 Ch. 2 Ethics for IT Workers and IT Users Case 4: SAP Found in Violation of FCPA 5 9/18 Ch. 3 Cyberattacks and Cybersecurity Case 5: Fairplay Turns to a Managed Security Service Provider 9/20 Ch. 3 Cyberattacks and Cybersecurity Case 6: Sony’s Response to North Korea’s Cyberattack 6 9/25 Ch. 4 Privacy Case 7: Serious Data Breach at OPM 9/27 Ch. 4 Privacy Case 8: Time to Update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act? 7 10/2 Ch. 5 Freedom of Expression Case 9: Techdirt Sued for Defamation 10/4 Ch. 5 Freedom of Expression Case 10: China’s Great Firewall 8 10/9  Ethical Lens Inventory  10/11  Professional Ethics Statement  9 10/16 Ch. 6 Intellectual Property (global perspective) Case 11: Target Hires Key Executive Away from Amazon 10/18 Ch. 6 Intellectual Property (global perspective) Case 12: Intellectual Property Fight over Virtual Reality Headset 10 10/23 Ch. 7 Ethical Decisions in Software Development Case 13: F-35 Plagued with Software Issues  10/25 Ch. 7 Ethical Decisions in Software Development Case 14: How Safe Are Self-Driving Cars? 11 10/30 Ch. 8 The Impact of IT on Society Case 15: IBM Watson—Not Yet Ready for Prime Time? 11/1 Ch. 8 The Impact of IT on Society Case 16: Sophia Genetics Moves Precision Medicine Ahead 12 11/6  Simulation 1: The Case of the Misbegotten Memo  11/8  Simulation 2: The Case of the Lamentable Launch  13 11/13 Ch. 9 Social Media Case 17: CDA Protects Social Media Companies 11/15 Ch. 9 Social Media Case 18: Google Losing Revenue in Dispute over Placement of Ads 14 11/20 Ch. 10 Ethics of IT Organizations Case 19: Disney Workers Replaced with H-1B Visa Workers 11/22 Ch. 10 Ethics of IT Organizations Case 20: E-Waste—An Important Global Environmental and Health Issue 15 11/27  Corporate Ethics Assessment  11/29  Peer Evaluation

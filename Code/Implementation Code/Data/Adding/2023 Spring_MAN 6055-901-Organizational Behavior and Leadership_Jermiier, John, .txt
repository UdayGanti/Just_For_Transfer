Course Description         
 
This course is intended to provide a foundatio n for the study of organization s and organizational behavior. 
It will familiarize participants with existing research, theories, models, concepts and issues in the field of 
Organizational Behavior.  It will provide the necessary academic background for further study in areas  
such as organizational theory, human resource management, leadership and interpersonal relations at 
work, organizational change and development, and related fields. Because the content of Organizational 
Behavior is derived mostly from research in work org anizations, it will apply directly to organizational 
problem solving and career management  issues .   
 
The usual pedagogical approach in the class emphasizes active involvement of all participants. 
Classroom sessions are structured around conceptual issues and will include videos, case analyses, 
experiential exercises, point -counterpoint discussions, self -assessment questionnaires, and other tools to 
promote active learning. If the course is successful, you will learn something about yourself and the field 
of study.  As necessary, w e will make adjustments to pedagogy to accommodate public health risks.    
 
Course Reading  
 
Colquitt, Jason A., LePine, Jeffrey A., and Wesson, Michael J. 2023. Organizational Behavior . New York:   
McGraw -Hill (8th Edition).  ISBN:  978-1-264-12435 -0 
 
The textbook is available in the campus bookstores  and through on line book s ources . Electronic versions 
of the book may be  available but cannot be used during open book, open notes exams  and quizzes . That 
is, no cell phones, tablets, laptops or other e lectronic devices  are permitted . Selected articles  and book 
chapters from the literature  on human behavior in organizations are also required  reading. They  will be 
available as PDF files on Canvas . Discussion Topics and textbook chapters are listed on p. 5 and 
required and optional advanced Canvas Readings  are listed at  the end of this Syllabus , pp. 7 -11.   
 
Course Requirements  
 
The final grade will be computed as a weighted average of (1) a multiple -choice , short  answer, essay  type 
midterm  exam --30%; (2)  a multiple -choice, short answer, essay type final exam —50%; and (3) active 
participation in all class sessions and activities , including quizzes and other written exercises —20%.  The 
exam s will cover all required readings and class  material. Active p articipation will be evaluated based on  
presentations and in depth discussions of the assigned readings.  Preparation for each class is essential  
and attendance is the baseline indicator of active participation . If a class member ’s partici pation  has not 
been satisfactory, his or her final grade will be adjusted downward. If a class member ’s participation has 
been highly effective, his or her final grade will be adjusted upward. Each class member is expected to 
fulfill a positive leadership role in the class. A group bonus is applied to grading when it is demonstrated 
that the class consistently operates as a high -performance team .   
 
We cannot give make -up exams or quizzes. It is impossible to ensure fairness when make -up exams or 
quizzes ar e given and it is practically impossible to accommodate the schedules of all the diverse 
students taking classes.  Organizational Behavior and Leadership

Canvas  
 
We will post all course material, syllabi, in structions, assignments, and related communications on 
Canvas. USF expects each student to engage fully with the course and with all course content posted on 
Canvas  or distributed in other ways.   
 
Classroom Etiquette   
 
In our learning environment, we strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and professionalism. 
So, please abide by the following norms specifi ed by the professor  and USF . (1) Arrive on time --late 
arrivals are disruptive to the professor, to the cond uct of the course, and to your fellow classmates. (2) 
Unless there is a personal emergency, show respect for our learning environment, the professor, and 
your fellow classmates by not leaving the classroom during our 90-100 minute periods. (3) Turn off you r 
cell phones and other communication devices before you enter the classroom —no calls, texting, web 
surfing, etc. (4) Avoid side conversations during the class since they can be distracting to the professor 
and other class participants . Recording of class sessions is not permitted because it can violate the 
privacy rights of students and because it can be disruptive and inhibit creativity and the free exchange of 
ideas.   
 
Disruption of the Academic Process  
 
Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder  the educational process. USF defines disruption of the 
academic process as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a classroom or other academic 
environment which in the reasonable estimation of the professor (a) directs attention away from the  
academic matters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of 
lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the 
health, safety, or well -being of self or other  persons.  
 
USF prohibits misconduct on the premises of all campuses of the USF System.  USF defines misconduct 
as any behavior that adversely affects the University community and/or the pursuit of its mission. This 
applies directly to the classroom, including virtual classroom meetings.  Please acquaint yourself with: 
http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/regulation -usf3.025.pdf  
  
Group Work Policy  
 
Everyone will be required to participate fully in group presentations and other exercises  in class. We will 
assign students to groups randomly.  
 
Extra Credit, Rewrites, and Late Work Policies  
 
Over the course of the semester, there will be numerous opportunities to demonstrate mastery of the 
material. You will be able to contribute to the course in ways that establish a grade reflecting high 
achievement.  Therefore, we will probably not offer ex tra credit assignments and we will not authorize 
rewrites or permit late work.      
 
No Unauthorized Personnel Allowed in Physical or Virtual Classroom s 
 
http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/regulations/pdfs/proposed -regulation -usf4.0140 -trespassing -loiterin g-
revised -021111.pdf prohibits other than registered students and invited guests from being present in the 
physical and virtual classrooms.

Policy on Incomplete G rades  
 
An "I" grade indicates incomplete coursework and may be assigned to a student only when a small 
portion of the student's work is incomplete and only when the student is otherwise earning a passing 
grade. We will give an incomplete grade only after f ull discussion of the relevant issues with the professor 
and only if the circumstances a student is facing are considered serious enough to compromise the 
student’s performance in the class markedly.   
 
Academic Fraud and Integrity of Students  
 
USF defines  and discusses Academic dishonesty in the University’s Undergraduate Catalogue (see 
Pages 44 -46 or see www.ugs.usf.edu/catalogs/0001/ADADAP.HTM). Academic dishonesty of any type 
will result in, at a minimum, an “F” for the assignment and may, depending upo n seriousness, result in an 
“F” for the course  and dismissal from the University . We cannot tolerate academic fraud, be it cheating, 
plagiarism, or any other form of dishonesty. Academic fraud interferes with open and honest exchange in 
the classroom. Beca use of this, we must work to strongly deter academic fraud.   
 
Turnitin Policies and Plagiarism Checks  
 
Submitting assignments to the SafeAssign Global Reference Database allows your paper to be checked 
for plagiarism against  all papers submitted to USF and other institutions. This ensures and protects the 
originality of your work. Turnitin also checks your written work for plagiarism against all published sources 
and internet sources. Become familiar with plagiarism restrictions and norms and be very  careful to cite 
properly any sources you use in formulating your answers. If you incorporate exact words from another 
source or person into your own writing, be sure to use quotation marks correctly and appropriately. It is 
very important that you neither  accidentally nor intentionally plagiarize any other source because this will 
result in serious academic consequences , including possible expulsion from USF .   
 
Students with Disabilities  
 
Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Stu dents with Disabilities Services (SDS) in 
order to receive academic accommodations.  SDS encourages students to notify instructors of 
accommodation needs at least 5 business days prior to needing the accommodation. A letter from SDS 
must accompany this req uest.  
 
Student Academic Grievance Procedures  
 
USF has procedures in place for students with academic grievances.  These can be found at  
http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/StudentAcademicGrievanceProcedures.pdf  
 
Gender -Based Crimes  
 
Educators must report inciden ts of gender -based crimes including sexual assault, sexual harassment, 
stalking, dating violence and domestic violence. If a student discloses in class, in papers, or to an 
instructor, the instructor is required by law to report the disclosure. The Center for Victim Advocacy and 
Violence Prevention (813 -974-5757) is a confidential resource where you can talk about such situations  
and receive assistance in confidence. Additional confidential resources on campus are: the Counseling 
Center (813 -974-2831) and Student Health Services (813 -974-2331).

Food and Housing Insecurity  
 
We recognize that student facing financial difficulty in securing a stable place to live and/or in affording 
sufficient groceries may be at risk of these financial issues affecting their performance in classes. 
Students with these needs are urged to contac t Feed -A-Bull (feedabull@usf.edu or their website), or 
Student Outreach and Support (socat@usf.edu or their website).

Statement of Academic Continuity  
 
In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to suspend normal operations. During this 
time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that include, but are not limit ed to: 
Canvas, Teams, email messaging, and/or an alternate schedule. It is the responsibility of the student to 
monitor the Canvas for each class for course -specific communication, and the USF, College, and 
Department websites, emails, and ALERTUSF message s for important general information (USF Policy 
6-010).

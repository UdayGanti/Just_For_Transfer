EXAMS: (75%) There will be 3 midterm exams each worth 25% of your grade. Exam questions will be based on material covered in any aspect of class (e. g. reading assignments, class lectures (video/in person), exercises, cases, and videos). The format of the exams will be a combination of multiple-choice questions and/or short answer/essay question(s) and are closed book.  The final exam is not cumulative and is worth 25% of your grade. Final exam questions will be similar to the Midterm Exam questions (i.e. multiple-choice and/or short answer). The exams will be timed. Additional information regarding the exam process will be provided closer to exam time. Please remember the University Academic Honesty policy (see below)! Cheating is not fair to other students and is not worth the consequences!  Online exams within this course will require online proctoring.

PARTICIPATION: (13%) In order to earn participation points, you must get involved.  Some exercises that we do in class are designed to help you gain insight into your own skills, abilities, and interests and how they relate to organizational behavior. We will do cases and ethical dilemmas in class. You can probably still earn an “A” if you miss one class due to illness, work issues, etc., however if you miss multiple classes, it will negatively impact your grade. Articulating your opinions and ideas and sharing relevant examples based on your experiences in the workplace will enhance the learning experience for everyone and deepen your understanding of the material.  Also, please feel free to point out any relevant news that related to the class. Professional behavior is expected at all times.  Please try to maintain a positive attitude and respect your professor and other students.

Course Hero / Chegg Policy: Contract cheating, paper mills, or the use of websites that enable cheating in this course are forbidden. The USF Policy on Academic Integrity specifies that students may not use websites that enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This does apply specifically to  .com and CourseHero.com – any use of these websites (including uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy.

Confidential personal and learning assistance counseling are made available to students through Student Accessibility Services.

Incomplete Grades: An “I” grade may be given to an undergraduate student only when a small portion of the student’s work (normally 30% or less) is incomplete due to circumstances beyond the control of the student and only when a student is otherwise earning a passing grade.  “I” grades are to be used only in emergency situations and cannot to be used as a means of avoiding a poor grade. Normally these are only for medical emergencies and require a signed letter from a medical professional that the student was prevented from attending class. The student must petition the professor before the week of final exams for a grade of “I” to be given.
The time limit for removing the “I” is to be set by the instructor of the course. For undergraduate students, this time limit may not exceed two academic semesters, whether or not the student is in residence, and/or graduation, whichever comes first.

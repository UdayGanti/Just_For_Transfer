               and Management and the lead ofStar-AI Labat the University of South Florida.Reza’s current research is focused on statistical and adversarial machine learning
               for AI-enabled secure and trustworthy cyberspace. He leverages a wide range of statistical
               learning theories, including Transductive Learning, Transfer Learning, Adversarial
               Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Reza’s dissertation on AI-enabled cybersecurity
               analytics won the ACM SIGMIS best doctoral dissertation award in 2021. Reza has published
               over 25 articles in peer-reviewed security journals, conferences, and workshops, includingIEEE TPAMI,Applied Artificial Intelligence,Digital Forensics,MIS Quarterly,JMIS,IEEE S&PW,AAAI Workshop,IEEE ICDMW, andIEEE ISI. He has been serving as a Program Chair and Program Committee member in IEEE ICDM
               Workshop on Machine Learning for Cybersecurity and IEEE S&P Workshop on Deep Learning
               and Security. He has contributed to several projects supported by the National Science
               Foundation. He is a member of the IEEE, ACM, AAAI, and AIS.Ebrahimi received his PhD in information systems from the University of Arizona, where
               he was a research assistant at the Artificial Intelligence Lab directed by Regents’
               Professor Hsinchun Chen, and a master's degree in computer science from Concordia
               University in Montreal at the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence

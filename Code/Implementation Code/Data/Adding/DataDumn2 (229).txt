The USF Muma College of Business has partnered with Knack to implement a peer tutoring
               program focused on preparing students for the workforce. Any student who has received
               an A- or better in a course may sign up to become a peer tutor on Knack. Not only
               do Knack tutors get paid to help their peers, they also unlock the ability to connect
               with employers for excellent internship and full-time employment opportunities. Knack
               makes it easy by creating a clear path towards landing your dream job and providing
               the resources needed to get there.

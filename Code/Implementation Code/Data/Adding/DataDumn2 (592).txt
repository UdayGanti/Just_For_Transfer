If You See Something, Say Something™

The University of South Florida is a proud member of the nationwide "If You See Something, Say Something™" campaign sponsored by the United States Department of Homeland Security. This safety and security
               campaign originated in the Transportation sector and has reached states, local communities,
               and Universities across the nation. The purpose of this campaign is to inform the
               community of the proper resources used to report suspicious activity and to empower
               the community to report these behaviors and actions.
Attached to all printed and digital outreach materials related to this campaign is
               a phone number for reporting any non-emergency related information. The reporting
               number on the flyers is 855-FLA-SAFE (855-352-7233) which connects to the Florida
               Fusion Center, the state's fusion center where suspicious activity reports will be
               received, analyzed, and shared with the necessary law enforcement officials. If there
               is suspicious activity that may pose an immediate threat, always call 9-1-1 to report
               the information to your local law enforcement agency.

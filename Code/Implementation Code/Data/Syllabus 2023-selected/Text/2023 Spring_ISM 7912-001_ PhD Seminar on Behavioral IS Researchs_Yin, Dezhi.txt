  1 ISM 7912 PhD Seminar on Behavioral IS Research School of Information Systems and Management Muma College of Business University of South Florida  Spring 2023 Thursday 2-4:45pm, CIS 2074  Professor:  Dr. Dezhi Yin Office Location: CIS 2078 E-mail:  dezhiyin@usf.edu  Course Description  The new generation of information and communication technologies including online word-of-mouth, social media, recommendation agents, and artificial intelligence are associated with digitization and disruption of business and social innovation, entrepreneurial processes, products and services, to a new cadre of business models, platforms, and social movements, and raised a variety of other behavioral, social, and economic challenges.  In the behavioral paradigm of information systems research, scholars investigate research questions related to micro- or meso-level information systems (IS) phenomena (e.g., IS use, consumer decision making in online environments), draw on theories from reference disciplines such as psychology, and use social science research methods such as surveys, experiments and field studies.   This doctoral seminar is intended to provide a foundation for doctoral students to achieve a broad understanding of the research areas and methods associated with behavioral IS research. This seminar also offers an exposition of how research problems are formulated and how the actual research is conducted and reported.  Course Objectives  This seminar is designed to provide newly or advanced doctoral students (or masters students aspiring to be doctoral students) across different disciplines a broad introduction to conceptual and theoretical perspectives and foundations in the key topics of information and communication technologies, help them appreciate the breadth, diversity, and significance of the digital phenomena, and enhance their ability to conceptualize and theorize about IT/digital related phenomena to their own research themes. This seminar also helps doctoral students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the commonly used research methodologies in information systems and develop a research project dealing with IT/digital-enabled and contemporary behavioral phenomenon of their choice. Students will also learn to be well versed in the process of publishing IT/digital-related research in IS and non-IS journals.     2 Learning Outcomes  Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:   • Get familiar with a range of topics studied in behavioral IS research, and learn to evaluate prior research critically • Choose a promising research topic capable of producing a program of research • Identify interesting, novel, and important research problems and questions • Explain the process of theory construction and how to make a research contribution • Formulate testable hypotheses and develop logical arguments • Explain differences among lab experiments, field experiments, and quasi/natural experiments • Design experimental studies that exhibit the various validities necessary for efficient and effective research  Class Materials: • All readings and other materials will be available via USF’s Canvas.  Structure and Evaluation  Grading Policy.  The final letter grade for this course will be based on the following:  Components: Reading notes  15%  Class participation 15% Discussion leadership 15% Intermediate milestones 15% Final paper  35% Paper review   5% Grading scale: 90-100 A  80-89 B 70-79 C 60-69 D  0-59 F  Reading Notes.  Before each class, you should thoroughly read ALL assigned readings (including those without “*”) and prepare a 2-3 pages’ reading note. A lack of “*” does not mean skip; speed read and familiarize yourself with those readings.  Your reading note should a) communicate your major take-away from reading each article, and b) integrate concepts across materials. If the reading is a topic paper, you should also c) provide your assessment of the paper’s contributions (why was this paper published?), d) summarize the article’s greatest strengths and critique its weaknesses, and e) come up with 3 new ideas you’d like to pursue that would be interesting.   For the readings you’re leading the discussion of, you should also f) prepare at least 2-3 key questions per reading that you want to have the class discuss.   You should turn in your reading notes by 10am of the day the readings are discussed. NO LATE READING NOTES WILL BE ACCEPTED.    3 Class Participation.  A PhD seminar is only effective when participants have carefully read and synthesized the assigned readings prior to class and are prepared to contribute to the class discussion. The seminar is intended to be highly interactive. You are expected to actively participate, debate, argue, and disagree in class discussions. To do so, you must (a) have digested and synthesized all the assigned readings in a timely manner and submitted your reading notes on time, (b) have finished all the “before class” tasks, and (c) not feel intimidated to speak up. I expect you to come prepared to discuss the required readings for each class. As you read them, be prepared to synthesize across the readings of the day (looking for the “forest” rather than “trees”) and attempt to relate them to the readings in the preceding weeks.  In determining the class participation grade, I will consider the following: familiarity with the assigned readings, ability to support or refute the readings, ability to integrate material from a diverse set of readings, ability to develop new ideas based on the readings, and ability to ask and answer relevant questions. Essentially, you will be graded on the thoroughness, sophistication, persuasiveness, and logic of your class comments.  It is important to note that a failure to meaningfully and regularly participate in class can result in a final grade of a full letter lower than that received on other graded items. Therefore, attendance is important – please arrange your schedule so that you will be able to arrive on time, attend each class, and stay for the entire class period.  Discussion Leadership.  The purpose of this assignment is to allow students to lead the class discussion on topics of importance in the course. Skills to be developed are teaching and facilitating skills, intellective skills, and verbal skills. When we discuss various IS topics each week, you may lead the discussion of articles and/or book chapters. A thorough and in-depth discussion is expected. For each reading, the leader will: (a) present a 2-minute opening analysis of the material (main take-away, why it was published), and (b) lead the subsequent class discussion. The intention is not for you to talk for half an hour or so. Instead, your job is to inspire your classmates and get them involved in the dialogue.  Final Paper: A Research Proposal and Presentation.  A major part of your grade is a research proposal and presentation for a highly focused study that uses the laboratory experiment method. The research proposal needs to focus on a new project of potential interest to you (and perhaps to a member of the faculty you are working with). This should be a new project, not one that the faculty member already has underway or something they have written up that you have helped as a RA. You are, however, most welcome to seek their input on the topic and your approach to it and it could be an extension of work you or the faculty member has previously done. Feel free to change the research question or topic the first half of the semester. However, you need to commit to a research question by the 7th week, along with theory base, etc.  The final paper will be written like a dissertation proposal (no longer than 15 double-spaced pages in Times 12 font, excluding references, figures, tables, design document, and IRB material). No data or results are required. The paper is expected to have the quality to be accepted as a research-in-progress by major IS conferences such as ICIS and CIST. Seek feedback from me early and often.    4 At a minimum, your final research proposal should include the following elements. 1. Introduction Section a. Abstract b. Introduction (what are you studying, why it is important, what’s new, to whom) 2. Theory and Hypotheses Section a. Literature review (synthesis that cuts across the prior research; be focused) b. Theoretical model with construct definitions and theoretical logic for the proposed hypotheses, and precisely formulated hypotheses 3. Methodology a. Research design and materials b. Brief overview of the intended/actual analysis approach 4. Results (optional) 5. Expected Contributions a. Expected research contributions (be precise) b. Expected practical significance and limitations 6. Appendix: design document, with cover story, manipulations, and all the measurements  The evaluation criteria of the final paper: • Is the research question developed and justified in a compelling way?  • Do the literature review and theory development synthesize recent ideas and advance them into a fresh theory, model, hypotheses, propositions? • Is the study (e.g., experiment) competently designed, taking into account various threats to internal validity? • Are the potential theoretical and practical contributions clearly laid out along with limitations? • Does the proposal exhibit high level of fit / internal consistency among the key elements including research question, prior work, theory, research design, and contributions? • Is writing clear, logical, and concise/to-the-point without grammar problems?  Intermediate Milestones.  You will use a staged approach to develop the research proposal, with multiple milestones. We will iteratively work through all aspects of your project as the semester progresses, applying the key insights from each session to developing your research proposal. Each intermediate milestone is due by the end of that week. NO LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.   You will be graded based primarily on genuine effort and be provided feedback on the deliverable at each milestone. Your submission should also include revisions to the previous stage(s)’s deliverable(s) and a response document–a summary of major changes that were made and point-by-point responses to issues that were raised.  Paper Review.  Each seminar participant is required to write up a critical peer review of a paper authored by another seminar participant. Partner in such a way that each student will review another student’s work and each student will be reviewed by another student. I will take the role of an associate editor (AE). In your review, identify strengths of the paper, fatal flaws (if any), and ways to improve the paper so that it is publishable in a premier journal like MISQ or ISR. Include both theoretical and methodological comments. Be specific, e.g., provide references.   5  Policies • Attendance rule: Arrive at class on time and do not leave early, unless you are excused in advance. • You-snooze-you-lose rule: Come prepared; “physical” & mental attendance is expected. • The bad eyesight rule: Everything submitted should be in Times 12-point font. • The 0-minute rule. Late submissions will automatically receive a grade of zero. • Honor code: I will do everything possible to maximize the penalty for violators.  Standard University Policies.  Policies about disability access, religious observances, academic grievances, academic integrity and misconduct, academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual harassment are governed by a central set of policies that apply to all classes at USF. These may be accessed at: https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspx • Academic Honesty: Students in this class are required to abide by the academic regulations of the university. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. Violations of academic integrity, including but not limited to plagiarism and cheating (in any manner, online or offline), are regarded as extremely serious matters and will be addressed to the fullest extent allowed by university regulations.  Communication.  Canvas will be used extensively for announcements, grades, readings, and other materials. It is your responsibility to check it on a regular basis. To communicate with me, please also do so on Canvas.  Campus Free Expression.  It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.   In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research.   Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.    6 Course Schedule (tentative)  Week 1: Introduction to Academia and Research (Jan. 12) Think about why you have chosen academia and what you expect for being a professor.

Narrow down to one idea that is deemed the most important, interesting and novel, convert this interest/puzzle into a problem statement (the starting point for your project’s motivation), and translate the problem into a focused research question. Submit 1-2 pages by the end of week, including the following: • Describe the research problem, enumerate why the problem is important from both a practical and scholarly standpoint, and specify the research question(s). • Identify and list 5-10 major articles in A-level journals in your field related to your idea. Get familiar with two business journal lists: UTD-24 and FT-50. Use Google Scholar to search keywords; to trace the major developments, use Google Scholar (or Web of Science) to track related papers using a handful of key conversant papers. • Provide a brief review of prior literature (describing themes across papers rather than describing papers one by one), and then articulate your intended contributions.    8  Week 4: Theory and Theorizing (Feb. 2) Identify at least one theory or theoretical perspective that you believe might be a promising starting point for your own study. Draw a simple boxes-and-arrows figure (the nomological network) with your dependent variable and a preliminary pool of independent variables in your research model. Think through two questions for class discussion: (a) How these variables are related to the theory you have selected and (b) why you included these and not others. Remember that your goal in model development is parsimony. Draft three formal hypotheses related to a main effect, a moderation, and a nonlinear relationship respectively. Think about the logic for your hypotheses. Submit your research model and hypotheses by 10am.  Readings: • * Gregor, S. (2006). The nature of theory in information systems.

Week 7: Proposal Presentation (Feb. 23) Prepare a presentation of your proposed idea, including motivation, research question, research model and presented hypotheses, planned study design, and intended contributions. Submit your presentation slides 2 hours before class starts.  Project Milestone 2: conceptual model.  Revise your drafted introduction section based on feedback you got so far. Draft the theory section: revise your research model and hypotheses, along with fully fleshed out arguments for the individual hypotheses (3-4 pages). Aim for at least 2-3 innovative, interesting, non-obvious, empirically testable, and non-trivial propositions/ hypotheses along with defensible arguments supporting each. Your arguments must build up to the individual hypothesis.  Week 8: Online Reviews (Mar. 2) Start drafting your study design section based on feedback.  • Jabr, W., Liu, B., Yin, D., & Zhang, H.

After class: Complete an IRB application of your study and submit it ASAP (by the end of the week at the latest). You may need to upload the questionnaire of your study, which is essentially a design document.  Week 10: Heuristics and Biases (Mar. 23) Continue to revise your design document based on this week’s readings. Find existing scale items that measure just the dependent variable in your research model. Be sure to use an existing/published scale where one exists (look this up before you reinvent the wheel). Here is a tool that might help you with this searching process (https://inn.theorizeit.org/). Adapt the scale(s) to your setting. The scale should begin with a precise theoretical and operational definition of the construct, its type explicitly identified (Likert, semantic differential, etc.), and a tentative set of anchors listed.  • Liu, Q.

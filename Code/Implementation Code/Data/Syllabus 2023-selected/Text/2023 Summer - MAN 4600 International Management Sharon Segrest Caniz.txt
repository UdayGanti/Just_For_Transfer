Welcome  to International Management! I am looking forward to a great semester and hope you all enjoy this class and learn some 
useful information. Understanding cross -cultural value differences can be very useful when working with individuals from different 
countries internationally or with members of different cultures domestically. This is one of the important competencies assoc iated with 
career readiness . Regardless of the career you choose, it is important to develop your global/intercultural fl uency.  
“Global/Intercultural Fluency:  Value, respect, and learn from diverse cultures, races, ages, genders, sexual orientations, and religions. 
The individual demonstrates, openness, inclusiveness, sensitivity, and the ability to interact respectfully wi th all people and understand 
individuals’ differences. ” (see http://www.naceweb.org/career -readiness/competencies/career -readiness -defined/   An overall objective 
of this course is to help you develop your global/intercultural fluency.  
 
Course Description  and Purpose :  Examines the effects of international cultural differences on business practices within and outside 
the United Sta tes and provides methods to build synergies and establish/enhance competitive advantage via those differences.  This 
course is designed to challenge you to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways in which culture affects manage ment 
decisions;  to examine more closely your own assumptions, values, and beliefs and consider how they may affect cross -cultural 
management situations; and to become more familiar with the values of different countries, cultures, and their management sty les.  
Internatio nal Management is an eclectic field which emphasizes culture’s effect on the managerial process and is based on disciplines 
such as the following:  anthropology, psychology, sociology, religion, history, and political science.  
 
Course  Prerequisite :  MAN 3025, Principles of Management  with a minimum grade of C .  
 
How to Succeed in this Course  
Given the complexity of international management , it is very important to thoroughly read all the assigned readings in the text while 
focusing on th e study guides provided. These chapters include a ton of information, and I w ill not regurgitate  everything in the text. 
Instead, I will go over the highlights of chapters , clarify confusing concepts  and provide examples. Take the time to go through the 
practice exam questions that are posted in Canvas. Listen to all video lectures while looking through the PowerPoints paying sp ecial 
attention to any notes in the PowerPoints (look at the notes view). Some students benefit from re -reading the chapters before  the exam. 
Making and studying flash cards of key terms and the definitions may also be helpful. Take the Honorlock  practice quiz to familiarize 
yourself with Honorlock  at the beginning of the semester. The supplemental videos , discussion boards  and intern ational spotlight cases  
included in each module provide examples of material in the textbook and help students to delve deeper into the course topics . Be sure 
to submit your discussion board posts and international spotlight cases on time to get full credi t. Late submissions lose 10 points per 
day.

multiple -choice  questions. Study guides and practice questions for the exams will be posted  and review will be available to those who 
are interested . 
 
Cases  (International Spotlights) : (18%) Please answ er questions completely and concisely. Do not answer questions with just a “no” 
or “yes” answer. Please elaborate. Late assignments will be penalized 10 points/day, so please prepare ahead of time to allow  for 
emergency situations such as illness or comput er problems. Submissions  with numerous  typos/ grammatical errors cannot earn a grade 
higher than a “C”, so please check your papers for errors. The write -ups of the International Spotlight cases  for each chapter are due 
each week by Sunday at midnight.  Please include citations or URLs for any websites  or other materials  you use  to answer the case 
questions . Researching and including supplemental material in addition to the case information is strongly encouraged. A rubric is 
inclu ded on Canvas.  
 
You are allowed to work on these together if you desire but  do turn in your own copy of the completed answers. If you work with others, 
do include the group member names on the paper.  In general, there are no wrong or right answers to man y of these question s but do 
show that you put  effort and thoug ht into learning about the spotlighted country and the associated issues . Hopefully , these cases will 
be an interesting and fun and help you to go beyond the theories in the book and learn more about specific countries . Some Cases are 
designed to help you gain insig ht into international management situations that might arise and how you would react.  
 
Participation  (Discussions ): (18%) In order to earn participation points, you must get involved.  Each week you will have a Discussion 
Board due. Responding to these posts by the deadlines will earn you participation points.  Late assignments are penalized 10 points per 
day and will be accepted up to 10 days late for partial credit. All the discussion boards will collectively count as 20%. You can probably 
still earn an “A” if you miss one assignment due to computer problems, illness, work issues, etc. You are also required to respond in 
a thoughtful and  polite manner to  at least  one other student  for each discussion board during the semester . Do take the time to 
read the Netiquette Guide posted on Canvas regarding professional online interactions. Questions regarding clarification of 
assignments or any personal questions should be emaile d to me directly.  Articulating your opinions and ideas  and sharing relevant 
examples based on your experiences will  enhance the learning experience for everyone and deepen your understanding of the material.  
Also, please feel free to point out any relevan t news that related to the class. Professional behavior is always expected  during this course .  
Please try to maintain a positive att itude and respect your professor  and other students. Please include citations or URLs for any websites  
or other materials  you use  in your discussion post . A rubric is included on Canvas.  
 
Quizzes: ( 4%) Chapter quizzes only count 4%. The quizzes test your knowledge of the chapter material and help you prepare for the 
exam. Quiz questions are in multiple -choice format. The lowe st quiz grade will be dropped.  
 
  3 Late or missed assignments or exams:   It is expected that all assignments will be completed and submitted by the due dates specified 
on the class sc hedule. Exams are to be taken within  the dat e rang e indicated on the class syllabus.   
If you are unable to ta ke an exam during the scheduled da te range  due to circumstances known in advance (e.g. an unavoidable 
school /work  event), you must make arrangements with me to take the exam before the scheduled exam date.  Otherwise, only extreme 
emergencies that can be verified  will be accepted as an exc use for missing the exam (in the event of an illness, a note from the doctor 
explicitly indicating that the student should not attend class is mandatory).  In the event of an emergency, it is your respo nsibility to 
contact me as soon as possible after the emergency (worst case, within 24 hours of the exam you missed). Make -up exams may be any 
format.     
 
Classroom Devices/Student Recording:  During exams calculators, tape recorders, cell phones, notes, books and other student -owned 
audio & technology device s are NOT allowed. All videos and other course materials are proprietary, and should not be shared, posted

Online Proctoring:  Quizzes and examinat ions will be conducted using an online proctoring tool called Honorlock . Keeping the audio 
and video (microphone and camera) on during such exams and quizzes is a must. If the student is not willing to use these, the  student is 
asked not to register for th is course. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/add period. 
Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a web cam (USB 
or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is purchased and 
controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with the permission of any person resid ing in the 
residence. To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University library and other 
academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for recordings, and students with concerns may discuss the  location of an 
appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recording s do not invade any third -
party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party priva cy concerns. Setup information will 
be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. For additional information about online proctoring you can visit the online p roctoring 
student FAQ at https://www.usf.edu/innovative -education/digital -learning/digital -learning-resources/honor_lock.aspx

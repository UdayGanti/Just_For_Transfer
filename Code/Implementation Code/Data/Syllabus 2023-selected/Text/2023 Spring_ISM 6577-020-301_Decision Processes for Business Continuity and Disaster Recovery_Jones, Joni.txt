Standard Policies :  
Online Proctoring of Quizzes  
All students  must  review  the syllabus  and the requirements,  including  the online  terms  and video  testing  requirements,  to 
determine  if they  wish  to remain  in the course.  Enrol lment  in the course  is an agreement  to abide  by and accept  all 
terms.  Any student  may  elect  to drop  or withdraw  from  this course  before  the end of the drop/add  period.   
Online  exams  and quizzes  within  this course  may  require  online  proctoring.  Therefore,  students  will be required  to have  a 
webcam  (USB  or internal)  with  a microphone  when  taking  an exam  or quiz.  Students  understand  that  this remote  
recording  device  is purchased  and controlled  by the student  and that  recordings  from  any private  residence  must  be 
done  with  the permission  of any person  residing  in the residence.   
To avoid  any concerns  in this regard,  students  should  select  private  spaces  for the testing.  Students  with  concerns  may  
discuss  location  of an appropriate  space  for the recor dings  with  their  instructor  or advisor.   
Students  must  ensure  that any recordings  do not invade  any third -party  privacy  rights  and accept  all responsibility  and 
liability  for violations  of any third -party  privacy  concerns.   
Students  are strictly  responsibl e for ensuring  that  they  take  all exams  using  a reliable  computer  and high -speed  
internet  connection.  Setup  information  will be provided  prior  to taking  the proctored  exam.  To use Honorlock,  students  
are required  to download  and install  the Honorlock  Google  Chrome  extension . For additional  information  please  visit 
the USF online  proctoring  student  FAQ  and Honorlock  student  resources .   
Online Exam Policy  
The following items are  NOT PERMITTED  within quizzes or exams.   
• Referencing any external resources (physical or digital) during the exam other than book and notes.  
4 • Receiving any form of assistance while taking the exam either in person or through a digital platform

Please see the university’s standard policies at:   
https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx .   
Campus Free Expression: The following statement was crafted as a suggested statement to include for course s that 
engage in discussions and instruction which students may find uncomfortable, unwelcome, disagreeable, or even 
offensive. These discussions are intended to be objective. Additional guidance related to HB 7 “Individual Freedom Act” 
can be found online.  
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where divergent ideas, 
theories, and philosophies can be openly excha nged and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this 
course may involve discussion of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an 
endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested by 
critical peer review and rigorous debate, a nd that the idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas 
are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and 
to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to 
believe it or agree with it.  
 
Title IX Policy :  
Title IX provides federal protections for discrimination based on sex, which includes discrimination based on 
pregnancy, sexual harassment, and interpersonal violence. In an effort to provide support and equal access, USF 
has designated all faculty (TA, Ad junct, etc.) as Responsible Employees, who are required to report any 
disclosures of sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship violence or stalking.  The Title IX Office makes 
every effort, when safe to do so, to reach out and provide resources and a ccommodations, and to discuss 
possible options for resolution.   Anyone wishing to make a Title IX report or seeking accommodations may do so 
online, in person, via phone, or email to the Title IX Office. For information about Title IX or for a full list of  
resources please visit:  https://www.usf.edu/title -ix/gethelp/resources.aspx . If you are unsure what to do, please 
contact Victim Advocacy – a confidential resource that can re view all your options – at 813 -974-5756 
or va@admin.usf.edu . 
Turnitin.com:   
  In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which instructors may use to quickly 
and easily compare each student's assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous database of 
student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all assignments in 
both hard copy and electronic format. Aft er the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive a report from  
turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment. For a more detailed look 
at this process visit http://www.tu rnitin.com . Essays are due at turnitin.com the same day as in class.

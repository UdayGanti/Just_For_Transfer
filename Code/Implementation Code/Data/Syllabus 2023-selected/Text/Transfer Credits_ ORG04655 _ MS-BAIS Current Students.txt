If you transfer into the MSBAIS from another program, either at USF or at a university elsewhere, you
can transfer up to 9 credits.  To do so, please send the syllabuses of the course you want to transfer
to muma-msbais@usf.edu  (mailto:muma-msbais@usf.edu) .  If you transfer from another university ,
also indicate which USF course you believe the course you want to transfer is equivalent to.  Also,
include a transcript in the email showing that you completed the courses you want to transfer and the
grade you received.  You can only transfer courses for which you received a B or better .
Professor Bhattacherjee will evaluate the transfer requests, and inform Professor Reichgelt. 
Professor Reichgelt will write to you from the muma-msbais@usf.edu  (mailto:muma-
msbais@usf.edu) to inform you of the decision.  If the decision is to transfer any credits, please

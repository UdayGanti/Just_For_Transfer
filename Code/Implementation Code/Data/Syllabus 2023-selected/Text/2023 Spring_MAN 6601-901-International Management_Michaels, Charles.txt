 VI. Team Project/Presentation :  The class will be divided into teams.  Each  team is responsible for 
choosing  a country/culture and developing a class presentation based on that country/cul ture.   A paper 
will accom pany the presentation .  The paper should be as long as needed to cover th e topic.  
Presentations will be graded on th e following:  
 
1.  Introduction: H ighlight the geographic and cultural background (e.g. Locatio n,                  population, 
Religion, bel iefs and attitudes).  History should be included to the extent that it in fluences the culture 
(e.g. Native American a nd Catholic influences on fatalis m in Mexican culture.) (10%)  
 
2.  What are the country ’s cult ural values?   If possible, I expect you to g o beyond Hofstede’s a nd 
Trompenaars’ dimensions and try to tell the class  what the culture is really like.  (20%) 
 
3.  What cultural problems might ari se and how do you plan to deal with them so as to           m inimize 
their impac t? (30%)

5.  Professionalism of pr esentation and written report. (20%)  
 
The pr esentations are to last approximately 50 minutes and will be followed by a question and answ er session.  
Each team member will receive individual feedback on th eir presenta tion style.  Since this is  a group proje ct, all 
members of a group will receive the same group score for the project.   Group participation scores will be 
assigned by group memb ers to each other.

 2 How to Succeed in this Course  
Given the large amount of information in the principles of  management  course , it is very important to thoroughly read all the assigned 
readings in the text while focusing on the study guides provided. These chapters include a ton of information, and I w ill not regurgitate  
everything in the text. Instead, I will go over the highlights of chapte rs, clarify confusing concepts  and provide examples. Take the time 
to go through the practice exam questions that are posted in Canvas. Listen to all video lectures while looking through the P owerPoints 
paying special attention to any notes in the PowerPoi nts (look at the notes view). Some students benefit from re -reading the chapters 
before the exam. Making and studying flash cards of key terms and the definitions may also be helpful. Take the Honorlock  practice 
quiz to familiarize yourself with Honorlock  at the beginning of the semester. The supplemental videos , discussion boards  and 
international spotlight cases  included in each module provide examples of material in the textbook and help students to delve deeper 
into the course topics. Be sure to submit your discussion board posts and international spotlight cases on time to get full credit. Late 
submissions los e 10 points per day.

Exams: (3 @2 0% each ) There will be 3  midterm exam s.  Exam questions can be based on material covered in any aspect of class (e. 
g. rea ding assignments, video chapter highlights , PowerPoints,  cases,  and supplemental videos). The format of th e exams will be  
multiple -choice  questions. Study guides and practice questions for the exams will be posted  and review will be available to those who 
are interested . 
 
Cases : (18%) Please answer questions completely and concisely. Do not answer questions with just a “no” or “yes” answer. Please 
elaborate. Late a ssignments will be penalized 10 points/day, so please prepare ahead of time to allow for emergency situations such as 
illness or computer problems. Submissions  with numerous  typos/ grammatical errors cannot earn a grade higher than a “C”, so please 
check y our papers for errors. The write -ups of the cases  for each chapter are due each week by Sunday at midnight.  Please include 
citations or URLs for any websites  or other materials  you use  to answer the case questions . Researching and including supplemental 
material in addition to the case information is strongly encouraged. A rubric is included on Canvas.  
 
You are allowed to work on these together if you desire but  do turn in your own copy of the completed answers. If you work with others, 
do include the gro up member names on the paper.  In general, there are no wrong or right answers to many of these question s but do 
show that you put  effort and thoug ht into learning about the spotlighted country and the associated issues . Hopefully , these cases will 
be an interesting and fun and help you to go beyond the theories in the book and learn more about specific countries . Some Cases are 
designed to help you gain insig ht into management situations that might arise and how you would react.  
 
Partici pation  (Discussions ): (18%) In order to earn participation points, you must get involved.  Each week you will have a Discussion 
Board due. Responding to these posts by the deadlines will earn you participation points.  Late assignments are penalized 10 poi nts per 
day and will be accepted up to 10 days late for partial credit. All the discussion boar ds will collectively count as 18 %. You can probably 
still earn an “A” if you miss one assignment due to computer problems, illness, work issues, etc. You are als o required to respond in 
a thoughtful and  polite manner to  at least  one other student  for each discussion board during the semester . Do take the time to 
read the Netiquette Guide posted on Canvas regarding professional online interactions. Questions regard ing clarification of 
assignments or any personal questions should be emailed to me directly.  Articulating your opinions and ideas  and sharing relevant 
examples based on your experiences will  enhance the learning experience for everyone and deepen your unde rstanding of the material.  
Also, please feel free to point out any relevant news that related to the class. Professional behavior is always expected  during this course .  
Please try to maintain a positive att itude and respect your professor  and other students. Please include citations or URLs for any websites  
or other materials  you use  in your discussion post . A rubric is included on Canvas.  
 
Quizzes: (4% ) Chapter quizzes only count 4%. The quizzes test your knowledge of the chapter materia l and help you prepare for the 
exam. Quizzes are in multiple -choice format.  
 
Late or missed assignments or exams:   It is expected that all assignments will be completed and submitted by the due dates specified 
on the class sc hedule. Exams are to be taken within  the dat e rang e indicated on the class syllabus.    3 If you are unable to ta ke an exam during the scheduled date range  due to circumstances known in advance (e.g. an unavoidable 
school /work  event), you must make arrangements with me to take the exam be fore the scheduled exam date.  Otherwise, only extreme 
emergencies that can be verified  will be accepted as an excuse for missing the exam (in the event of an illness, a note from the doctor 
explicitly indicating that the student should not attend class is  mandatory).  In the event of an emergency, it is your responsibility to 
contact me as soon as possible after the emergency (worst case, within 24 hours of the exam you missed). Make -up exams may be any 
format.     
 
Classroom Devices/Student Recording:  During exams calculators, tape recorders, cell phones, notes, books and other student -owned 
audio & technology devices are NOT allowed. All videos and other course materials are proprietary, and should not be shared, posted 
or used in any way outside of the c urrent class.  
 
Canvas : This course will be offered via USF's learning management system (LMS), Canvas. If you need help learning how to perform 
various tasks related to this course or other courses being offered in Canvas, please consult the Canvas hel p guide 
(https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student/gh -p/student ). You may also contact USF's IT department at (813) 974 -1222 or 
help@usf.edu . It is strongly advised that you  login to Canvas and  print out your syllabus right away . Keep it handy so you don’t miss 
any deadlines -especially the exams . Put the exam dates on your calendar, and don’t forget to login to Canvas to check announcements 
daily if possible . Please keep up with course announcements in Canvas that include important course reminders and other information 
that will be helpful in succeeding in this class.  
 
Online Proctoring:  Quizzes and examinations will be conducted using an online proctoring tool called Honorlock . Keeping the audio 
and video (microphone and camera) on during such exams and quizzes is a must. If the student is not willing to use these, the  student  is 
asked not to register for this course. Any student may elect to drop or withdraw from this course before the end of the drop/ add period. 
Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required to have a webcam (USB 
or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this remote recording device is purchase d and 
controlled by the student and that recordings from any private residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the 
residence. To avoid any concerns in this regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University librar y and other 
academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for recordings, and studen ts with concerns may discuss the location of an 
appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recording do not invade any third -
party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for viol ations of any third -party privacy concerns. Setup information will 
be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. For additional information about online proctoring you can visit the online p roctoring 
student FAQ at http://www.usf.edu/innovative -education/resources/student -services/online -proctoring.aspx  
 
Class Recording:  Exam reviews will be recorded and po sted online. Student’s voice and video may be included in the class recording. 
It is the student’s responsibility to make sure the privacy of their surroundings and background is maintained.

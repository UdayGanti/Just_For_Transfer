How does the MS-BAIS program work?
The program requires a minimum of 33 credits, which must include 5 core classes, 3 MS-BAIS
electives and 3 additional electives from our department or other departments if they are 6000 level
courses relevant to the major . Most of these classes are 3 credits each. In addition, you can also take
MS-BAIS internships and independent study , which are 1-2 credit courses and those courses will also
count toward your 33 credit degree requirements.
Before registering for any out-of-department electives, please consult Dr . Johannes Reichgelt to
make sure that this course would count toward your degree requirement. For non-departmental
courses, you will need a permit from that department.
 
What are the dif ferent core and elective course options that I have for my MS-BAIS degree?
MS-BAIS core classes:
1. ISM 6124: Advanced Systems Analysis & Design (Prerequisite: Systems Analysis & Design or
equivalent professional knowledge)
2. ISM 6218: Advanced Database Management (Prerequisite: Database Design/Management or
equivalent professional knowledge)
3. ISM 6225: Distributed Information Systems (Prerequisite: Object-Oriented Programming or
equivalent professional knowledge)
4. QMB 6304: Analytical Methods for Business (Prerequisite: One prior course on inferential
statistics at undergraduate or graduate level)
5. ISM 6155: Enterprise Information Systems Management (MS-BAIS capstone)
NOTE : In order not to jeopardize your chances to graduate on time, it is crucial that you complete the
core courses as early as possible.  W e have had a number students who did not take core courses
when they were available, and then had to postpone their graduation.  This is particularly problematic
for international students who have to maintain a full course load and therefore may have to take
more courses than is strictly necessary to complete their program.
MS-BAIS electives:  
We have many electives. This is a partial list of approved electives in no particular order . Refer to our
course catalog for a complete list.
1. ISM 6136: Data Mining
2. ISM 6419: Data V isualization
3. ISM 6137: Statistical Data Mining (Prerequisite: QMB 6304)10/13/23, 12:18 PM MS-BAIS Advising FAQ: ORG04655 : MS-BAIS Current Students

12. ISM 6945: BAIS Internship (1 credit for both full-time and part-time internships, max 3 credits for 3
semesters)
13. ISM 6905: Independent Study (1 or 2 credits)
Prerequisites for any class must be completed in a PREVIOUS semester . Concurrent enrollment in a
class AND its prerequisite in the same semester is not allowed. If you need help with prerequisites,
please e-mail Dr . Reichgelt.
 
Are there any ISM/QMB classes that can't be used towards graduation?  
Yes. Classes that can't be used as MS BAIS electives include a ny undergraduate class, most 2 or 3
credit MBA  courses or MBA  sections of MS-BAIS courses such as ISM 6930-Data Analytics for
Business,  QMB 6305, QMB 6358, QMB 6603,  ISM 6021, ISM 6123 (Fund of Data Mgmt &
Analysis),  ISM 6436,  ISM 6217.  Some other graduate College of Business classes may be
ineligible.  Please contact Dr . Johannes Reichgelt if you plan to register for any of these courses or
have any questions in this regard.
 
How many credits can I register for?  
There is a limit to the number of courses you can register for .  In the regular semesters, i.e. Fall and
Spring, you can register for at most 4 courses (12 credits).  In the Summer , you can register for at
most 2 courses (6 credits).  There are additional rules that apply when you have a full-time internship
and these rules are explained in the CPT  module.  USF insists that you enroll for at least 2 credits in
your graduating semester .  This includes the Summer semester .
The Lean Six Sigma course counts towards the 12 credits if you take in the Spring, but not if you take
it in the Fall.  The Spring course is in the middle of the semester; the fall course is of fered before the
Fall semester starts.
 
How can I register for alternate calendar classes?  10/13/23, 12:18 PM MS-BAIS Advising FAQ: ORG04655 : MS-BAIS Current Students
https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1794296/pages/ms-bais-advising-faq?module_item_id=28098679 3/6Use this link: https://www .usf.edu/registrar/register/altcalendar .aspx
(https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/altcalendar.aspx)  
Contact the registrar's of fice at 974-2000 for if you have concerns about late add fees.  You should be
able to drop alternate classes during the first scheduled week without penalty , but again - this is the
registrar's domain, so always check with them to confirm.
 
Some courses require a permit.   How do I get one?  
If you look up the course on https://usfweb.usf.edu/DSS/StaffScheduleSearch
(https://usfweb.usf.edu/DSS/StaffScheduleSearch) , you will see link in the description of the course. 
Click that link and complete the form that comes up.  Please do NOT  email the professor for the
course.  They cannot issue permits.
 
What delivery modes are courses of fered in, and how can I find out the delivery mode of a
course?
We offer courses in three dif ferent modes:
Face-to-face
Asynchronously online
Synchronously online
The dif ference between the latter two is that the latter will require synchronous meetings via Teams,
whereas the former does not.   
If a course section in https://usfweb.usf.edu/DSS/StaffScheduleSearch
(https://usfweb.usf.edu/DSS/StaffScheduleSearch) has both a time associated with it and a classroom,
it is a face-to-face course.  Online courses will always have Of f-Campus in the Campus field. 
Synchronous online courses will contain a note that gives the dates on which the classes meet.  If
there is no such note, the class is asynchronous, even though the Time field will say TBA.  The
system will not allow us not to put a time in that field.  
Notes:
1. The Off-Campus  note is likely to be followed by the name of a campus (e.g., Off-Campus -
Tampa , or Off-Campus - Sarasota-Manatee ).  Ignore the name of the campus.  This is included
for internal financial purposes and does not af fect how the course is delivered.
2. Online courses are a little more expensive than face-to-face courses.  USF charges an additional
fee for online courses.  At the moment, the charge is $30.

https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1794296/pages/ms-bais-advising-faq?module_item_id=28098679 4/6How do registration wait-lists work at USF?  
Please see:  http://www .usf.edu/registrar/resources/waitlist
(http://www.usf.edu/registrar/resources/waitlist/)  Please do not place yourself on more than one
waitlist for the same course. If you do, we will remove you from all waitlists for that course.
 
Can I take all my classes online?  
From Fall 2023 onwards, international students can take at most one course online, and must take all
their other courses on campus.  CPT internships and independent study courses count as on-campus
courses.
How do I know which classes will be of fered next semester?  
You can see courses of fered in future semesters by using USF staff search
(http://usfweb.usf.edu/DSS/StaffScheduleSearch) , but keep in mind that this is a tentative schedule
that is subject to change. The final course schedule will be available 1-2 months before the start of
the semester .
 
What courses are of fered in summer?
Most of our students do internships in summer . Hence, we have relatively few course of ferings in the
summer . Most elective classes, and well as many core classes, are not of fered in summer . We may
also cancel classes that have very few students. Hence, if you plan to graduate in summer , plan your
coursework carefully to ensure that you can register for the classes you need to graduate in summer . 
 
How do we register for the Lean Six Sigma class?  
The Lean Six Sigma class is usually of fered the week before the start of the Fall semester but is
considered an alternate calendar fall class.  It's also frequently of fered in the spring, during the week
of spring break.  A permit is needed to register (see the link in the schedule search) and tuition
waivers don't cover this class.
 
What is reduced course load (RCL) and how do I apply for it?  
Reduced course load (RCL) through International Student Services when you are taking fewer than 9
credits. International students are allowed to do this ONL Y in their graduating semester .  You must
apply for RCL  at the International Student Services of fice; include Dr . Reichgelt ( reichgelt@usf.edu10/13/23, 12:18 PM MS-BAIS Advising FAQ: ORG04655 : MS-BAIS Current Students
https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1794296/pages/ms-bais-advising-faq?module_item_id=28098679 5/6(mailto:reichgelt@usf.edu) ) as the "approver" in this application. Send him an e-mail informing him of
which courses you want to take in the RCL  semester .   
If you have a full-time CPT  internships, this counts as a full course load and you don't need an RCL. 
Part-time internships are NOT  eligible for RCL  unless it is the student's last semester at USF .

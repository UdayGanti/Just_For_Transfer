University Course Description: Verbatim from USF’s course inventory  
The purpose of this seminar is to familiarize you with the current academic discourse involving 
information systems and related areas for you to conduct or inform your independent research in these 
areas. We will focus on some major areas that I believe offer interesting and significant opportunities 
to identify and tackle some first -order questions.

COURSE OBJECTIVE  
This course offers a survey of current research involving information systems. The purpose of this seminar is 
to familiarize you with the current academic discourse involving information systems and related areas for 
you to conduct or inform  your independent research in these areas. We will focus on some major areas that I  
believe offer interesting and significant opportunities  to identify and tackle some first -order questions.   
 
STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES  
After taking this course, students  should be able to:   
 Describe current academic discourse and empirical research in selected domains to critically evaluate 
theoretical arguments, use or critique these arguments in their research, and evaluate the links between 
theoretical arguments and empirical methods  
 Explore and develop research ideas to internalize what they learn through r eadings and discussions 
and to make progress towards publishing the most promising ideas   
 
ASSIGNED READINGS   
I have selected some readings to give you an exposure to theories, concepts, and empirical work to present an 
overview of a particular research stream. Most of the required readings should be available electronically 
through the library, and instructor will provide any readings or other working papers that you are unable to 
locate there.  
 
                                                 
1 The syllabus is tentative and subject to change. Any changes will be announced in class and/or documented via 
Canvas/email. We will discuss any changes to schedule if there are any scheduling conflicts that the instructor may run 
into over the semester. Some sessions may be conducted using Teams.

 2 COURSE STRUCTURE AND CONDUCT  
The class will be highly inter active and discussion -oriented. It is required that all participants complete all 
required readings prior  to coming to class. Assuming no legitimate reason, failure to do the readings will result 
in the participant being excused from the class meeting and docked one letter grade each time.  In order to 
achieve our goal, it is not sufficient to simply read the articles but t o think about them critically. Often this 
requires readin g the articles more than once.  
 
Grading  
 
The final grade will be based on performance on summary of papers assigned to you, your performance 
as a session discussant, class participation, and term paper. Late assignments are not accepted.  
 
 30% : Session summaries and class participation  
While all  students are expected to read all papers and contribute to discussion in each class, 
each student will lead the discussion for his or her assigned papers.  In the lead role, the 
student in charge of a particular paper should bring a 1- 2 page summary of th e assigned 
paper(s) to class.  In general, such a summary should provide a brief overview of the research 
questions, theoretical framework, hypotheses, what authors found, contributions, relationship 
of the paper with other papers and findings, and potenti al extensions (or future research that 
can overcome the limitations of that paper).  Talk about both positives and negatives of the 
paper and offer your conjectures on why the paper was published or what may make this paper 
publishable (if it is a working paper). I certainly want to see a section on some “doable” future 
research projects that will extend or improve what this paper was trying to do. Just a summary 
and “copy and paste” of paper’s tables and figures is not acceptable-- we are looking for your 
critique and value added comments . Students will bring hard copies of their summary for 
everyone to the class and post a soft copy of the summary on course website.   
 
You are expected to have a healthy skepticism in critiquing a paper, but I also encourage  you 
to be “constructive” and always have a remedial and reasonable suggestion accompanying 
your critique that will make a paper better or how future research can overcome the limitations 
of the paper that you will be discussing.  Being positive does not, however, mean that we will 
shy away from discussing what may be considered as flaws in theoretical justifications, 
empirical aspects or writing. But whenever you point to those, tell us how you would have 
approached those issues given the same research question and the data to which authors had 
access.   
 
Beyond leading the discussion of the paper assigned to you, each of you should identify the 
unifying themes of that week’s readings to develop a mental map of the “state of the art” in 
that area to identif y potential dis sertation topics that will significantly advance that stream of 
work.  
 
• 70% : Term Paper  
 
Develop an original research proposal or paper (not more than 20 pages double spaced with 
Tables, Figures and References) on any phenomenon of your lik ing that addresses some IT 
related issue (broadly construed). Your paper must address the following issues:  
 
1. What is the research question? Why is it interesting? How will an answer to this 
question change how we think about that issue theoretically or how we may like to 
manage that particular issue in a better way than we otherwise would? Discuss both 
theoretical and managerial relevance very briefly. [Introduction]  
2. How has it been studied in the prior literature? What is your research model and how 
do your hypotheses make new theoretical or empirical contributions? [Literature 
Review, Research Model]  
3. How will you test your hypotheses? [Research Method or Design]  Syll_DiscpIntrfcs_Spr2023_21Jan2023v2km         3 of 18 
 
 3 4. What results do you expect to find or have found? [Results]  
5. What is unique, new and valuable about your proposed study? What are the key 
contributions? What are the research and managerial implication s? What are the 
limitations of your proposed study? How can you extend your research further? 
[Discussion, Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research]  
 
 
Please be prepared to report your progress every week in class and incorporate the feedback 
from instructor and classmates to continuously improve your work.   
 
 
GRADING SCALE  
 
Grading scale:  A+: Over 95%, A: 93 -95%, A -: 90-93%, B+: 87- 90%, B: 83- 87%, B -: 80-83%, C+: 77- 80%, 
C: 73 -77%, C -: 70-73%, D+: 67- 70%, D: 63- 67%, D -: 60-63%, F: Below 60%  
 
Stude nts typically earn B letter grades for good performance and for meeting all expectations; the A grades 
are for extraordinarily excellent performance when students exceed expectations. The final letter grades will 
be based on the distribution of course poin ts at the end of the semester and instructor’s overall assessment of 
your performance relative to your classmates.

Here are some policies documented in the syllabus as suggested or required by USF.   
 
Class Policies:  
 
Communication : Please check course website frequently for updated postings and course related 
communications.  If you have any appropriate and course -related question, first check syllabus or course 
website to ensure that you are not asking something that is already ment ioned in the syllabus or website. If 
you are not able to find answer to your question, then post your question under Discussions at Canvas 
(Canvas>Discussions>"General Questions")  so that TA and/or I can answer your question appropriately 
via that channel or in the next class meeting. If you need to send me an email then please mention your cell 
phone number in the message of your email so that I can call you if necessary (if the question pertains to 
your group work, please copy all your teammates so that I  can reply to all).  
 
Class Attendance and Etiquette:  I do not take formal attendance in class but I do keep track of who is 
coming to class and who is not. Skipping classes means that you will miss valuable content that we cover in 
class and you will do po orly in the exams. Also, please do not disrupt the class by coming to class late or 
leaving early, arrive 5 minutes early rather than 5 minutes late. If you skip classes or engage in disruptive 
side conversations, don’t expect much sympathy from me at the end of the semester.  
 
Cell Phones:  While in class, turn your cell phones, iPods etc to silent mode, and step out of the class if you 
must take or make an important phone call. See USF’s official policy on class disruption at

Free Riders in Teamwork (if applicable):  Team members who do not come to team meetings or contribute 
satisfactorily to their assigned team work in a timely manner will receive at least one letter grade lower than 
the rest of their team. There will be no make -ups for free riders.  
 
Your Suggestions : Administration will request you to provide comments regarding various aspects of the 
course toward the conclusion of the course, but those comments come too late to make any mid -course 
corrections. Hence, please discuss with me any ideas that can potentially improve your learning experience 
during the semester. Because the instructor also has responsibili ty for learning experience of the entire class 
and to ensure that course objectives are met while maintaining rigor, it may not be feasible to accept all 
suggestions. Even if your suggestions are not accepted, they can still help us to design other courses  or 
activities in future so feel free to suggest from your side.  
 
Please understand that this syllabus constitutes a CONTRACT  between you and me.  By registering for this 
class, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions as stated in this contract.  These terms will be strictly 
enforced, without exceptions.  If you find these terms unreasonable, you can drop the class and take it in a 
different semester with a different professor.  
 
 
Other Policies Required or Suggested by USF for All Courses3 
Academic Int egrity : Academic integrity is the foundation of the University of South Florida System’s 
commitment to the academic honesty and personal integrity of its university community. Academic integrity 
is grounded in certain fundamental values, which include hone sty, respect, and fairness. Broadly defined, 
academic honesty is the completion of all academic endeavors and claims of scholarly knowledge as 
representative of one’s own efforts. The final decision on an academic integrity violation and related 
academic s anction at any USF System institution shall affect and be applied to the academic status of the 
student throughout the USF System, unless otherwise determined by the independently accredited 
institution. The process for faculty reporting of academic miscon duct, as well as the student’s options for 
appeal, are outlined in detail in USF System Regulation 3.027 .

I have a zero -tolerance policy  for plagiarism or cheating.  Plagiarism includes claiming/editing others’ work 
and presenting it as your own, lifting materials from the Internet or other sources without attribution, and 
many others. Per USF policy, any such behavior will result in a zer o grade for that grade component for the 
first offense, F grade in the class and report to the Dean’s Office for the second offense, and dismissal from 
the program for third offense. There will be no make up for any plagiarized work. See USF’s academic 
integrity policy at http://www.ugs.usf.edu/policy/AcademicIntegrityOfStudents.pdf . 
 
Disruption to Academic Progress: Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the education al 
process. Disruption of the academic process is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a 
classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the instructor: (a) directs 
attention away from the academic mat ters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or 
abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents 
a danger to the health, safety, or well -being of self or other persons.  
 
Academic Grievance Procedure: The purpose of these procedures is to provide all undergraduate and 
graduate students taking courses within the University of South Florida System an opportunity for objective 
review of facts and events pertinent to the cause of  the academic grievance. An “academic grievance” is a 
claim that a specific academic decision or action that affects that student’s academic record or status has 
violated published policies and procedures, or has been applied to the grievant in a manner di fferent from 
that used for other students.  
 
Disability Access: Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Students with Disabilities 
Services (SDS) (SVC 1133) in order to receive academic accommodations. SDS encourages students to 
notify instructors of accommodation needs at least five (5) business days prior to needing the 
accommodation. A letter from SDS must accompany this request.  
 
Sexual Misconduct / Sexual Harassment : USF is committed to providing an environment free from sex 
discrimination, including sexual harassment and sexual violence ( USF System Policy 0 -004). The USF 
Center for Victim is a confidential resource where you can t alk about incidents of sexual harassment and 
gender -based crimes including sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence. This confidential 
resource can help you without having to report your situation to either the Office of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities  (OSSR) or the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Equal Opportunity  (DIEO), unless you 
request that the y make a report. Please be aware that in compliance with Title IX and under the USF System 
Policy, educators must report incidents of sexual harassment and gender -based crimes including sexual 
assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence. If you d isclose any of these situations in class, in 
papers, or to me personally, I am required to report it to OSSR or DIEO for investigation. Contact the USF 
Center for Victim Advocacy and Viol ence Prevention : (813) 974- 5757. 
 
Religious Observances : All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably 
accommodate their religious observances, practices and beliefs ( USF System Policy 10 -045). The USF 
System, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required classes and examinations in view 
of customarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or communi ties comprising the USF 
System’s constituency. Students are expected to attend classes and take examinations as determined by the 
USF System. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time 
prohibited by his or her religious belief. However, students should review the course requirements and 
meeting days and times to avoid foreseeable conflicts, as excessive absences in a given term may prevent a 
student from completing the academic requirements of a specific course.  Students are expected to notify 
their instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced 
examination, in accordance with this Policy.  
 
Statement of Academic Continuity : In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to suspend 
normal operations. During this time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that 
include, but are not limited to: Learning Management System, online conferencing, email messaging, and/or 
an alter nate schedule. It is the responsibility of the student to monitor the Learning Management System for Syll_DiscpIntrfcs_Spr2023_21Jan2023v2km         18 of 18 
 
 18 each class for course- specific communication, and the main USF, College, and Department websites, emails, 
and MoBull messages for important general information ( USF System Policy 6 -010). For additional 
guidance on emergency protective actions and hazards that affect the University, please visit 
www.usf.edu/em   
 
End of Semester Student Evaluations:  All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to 
provide feedback to the University regarding the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of 
the semester, and the University will notify you by email when the response window opens. Your 
participation is highly encouraged and valued.  
 
Campus Free Expression (Fall 2022) : The following statement was crafted as a suggested 
statement to include for courses that engage in discussions and instruction which students may find 
uncomfor table, unwelcome, disagreeable, or even offensive. These discussions are intended to be 
objective. Additional guidance related to HB 7 “Individual Freedom Act” can be found online.  
It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment where 
divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. 
Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussion of ideas that you find 
uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an 
endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objecti ve means that the idea(s) presented can 
be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible 
research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that 
certai n ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to 
engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an 
idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.  
 
COVID Addendum  
All students must comply with university policies and posted signs regarding COVID -19 mitigation 
measures, including wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing.   Failure to do so may result 
in dismissal from class, referral to the Student Con duct Office, and possible removal from campus.  
Students must follow USF’s policies in effect at all times and refer to the following websites for updates and 
latest information:

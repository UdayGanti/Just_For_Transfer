Searching for classes and current enrollment:
You can search on Oasis, but the staff schedule search  is an easier interface to use.

Please make sure that you read the description of the course carefully .  Some courses are only
available to students who are enrolled in specific programs, such as the Global BAIS or the Online
MBA, and if you are not enrolled in these programs, you will not be eligible to register for these
courses.
If you need to register for an alternate calendar course , you can use the alternate calendar link:
 https://www .usf.edu/registrar/register/altcalendar .aspx
(https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/altcalendar.aspx)
(https://www.usf.edu/registrar/register/altcalendar.aspx) .  If this doesn’t work, email Dr . Reichgelt
(muma-msbais@usf.edu  (mailto:muma-msbais@usf.edu,) ) or contact the Registrar ’s office at 974-
2000.
 
Course sequencing & prerequisite checks:
As described in the catalog  (https://catalog.usf.edu/preview_program.php?
catoid=18&poid=7726&hl=%22BAIS%22&returnto=searchhttps://catalog.usf.edu/preview_program.php?
catoid=18&poid=7726&hl=%22BAIS%22&returnto=search) , certain classes have course prerequisites
(e.g., ISM 6124 Advanced Systems Analysis and Design and ISM 6218 Advanced Database Systems
are both prerequisites for ISM 6155 Enterprise Information Systems Management ).  In general, you
cannot directly register for the advanced classes without completing the prerequisites in a prior
semester . Note that concurrent enrollment in prerequisite and advanced classes is not allowed.  
In addition, certain core MS-BAIS classes like Advanced Database Management have pre-program
prerequisites such as a database prerequisite, which can be met by virtue of a prior course in
database management from your previous university or adequate working experience with databases
in a corporate environment. Similarly , there are prerequisites for Advanced Systems Analysis &
Design and Distributed Information Systems. If you don't meet these core prerequisites, you will have
to register for basic courses in these areas at USF and these courses will NOT  count toward the 33-
credit MS-BAIS degree requirement. If you are unsure which prerequisites you need, email Dr .
Reichgelt ( muma-msbais@usf.edu  (mailto:muma-msbais@usf.edu,) ) with your U# and USF email
address and request a prerequisite check.  Every new student must have their prerequisites checked
and any outstanding prerequisites should be completed by the end of your first semester .10/13/23, 11:35 AM Course Registration: ORG04655 : MS-BAIS Current Students
https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1794296/pages/course-registration?module_item_id=28098677 2/4The following are the required pre-program prerequisites:
Database prerequisite  >> prerequisite for >> ISM 6218 Advanced Database Management.
Systems analysis & design prerequisite  >> prerequisite for >>  ISM 6124 Advanced Systems
Analysis & Design 
OOP  prerequisite  >> prerequisite for  >> ISM 6225 Distributed Information Systems 
Stats prerequisite  >> prerequisite for > QMB 6304 Analytical Methods for Business
In addition, we strongly suggest that you take courses in a specific sequence.  Past experience has
shown that students who have not taken the courses in the suggested sequence are less successful.
Take ISM 6124 Advanced Systems Analysis & Design  before you take ISM 6208 Data
Warehousing . 
Take ISM 6225 Distributed Information Systems  before you take  ISM 6562 Big Data for Business
Applications. 
Take QMB 6304 Analytical Methods for Business  before you take  ISM 6137 Statistical Data
Mining . 
Take ISM 6136 Data Mining  before you take  ISM 6251 Data Science Programming  before you
take ISM 6564 T ext Analytics or ISM 6930 T echnical Foundations of AI
NOTE 1: We have been a bit lax in enforcing prerequisites.  Starting in the Fall of 2023, we will
strictly enforce prerequisites and remove students from courses if they have not met the
prerequisites.
NOTE 2 : With the increase in enrollment in the program, we cannot guarantee that we can of fer the
core courses (see next page) in every semester .  You should therefore take a core course whenever
it is available and you are eligible to take it.  If you do not, you may not be able to graduate on time.
 
Electives:
We have a wide range of departmental and non-departmental electives for you to choose from to
enrich your learning experience at USF . Note that you must complete 9 credits of departmental
(BAIS) electives and another 9 credits of BAIS and/or non-BAIS electives for your MS-BAIS degree.
Non-departmental electives must be pre-approved by Dr . Reichgelt before you register in those
courses, and may require a permit from the corresponding department. Departmental electives must
satisfy prerequisites as described above.
Any USF class may not count as "electives" for your 33-credit MS-BAIS degree. Classes that won't
count include any undergraduate class, most 2 or 3-credit MBA  courses such as  ISM 6930 (Data
Analytics for Business), QMB 6305, QMB 6358, QMB 6603, ISM 6021, ISM 6123, ISM 6436, ISM
6217, and many other Muma College of Business classes.10/13/23, 11:35 AM Course Registration: ORG04655 : MS-BAIS Current Students

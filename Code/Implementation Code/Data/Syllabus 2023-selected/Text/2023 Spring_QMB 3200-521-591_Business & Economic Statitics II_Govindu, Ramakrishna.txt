critical thinking, problem solving, analytical skills that would help you throughout your career in business and 
industry. The purpose of QMB 3200 is to help students in acquiring skills to apply statistical tools and 
techniques in business analytics and decisi on making in various business environments. This course integrates 
Excel into the course. When mastered, and through practice and experience, these skills can help get into 
high paying jobs, and help with career development.  
 
II. University Course Description  
Simple linear regression and correlation; multiple regression and model building; forecasting models; analysis of 
variance; chi -square tests; nonparametric methods .  
 
III. Course Prerequisites  
MAC 2233 or MAC 2241, QMB 2100.   
 
IV. Course Purpose   
QMB 3200 is the second course in Statistics. It builds upon the foundation established in your first course in 
Statistics (QMB 2100 or its equivalent). The purpose of QMB 3200 is to prepare students to appreciate the role 
statistics plays in business analytics and dec ision making. In particular, the course emphasizes and prepares 
students to “learn concepts and methods”, “solve/analyze problems”, “interpret reports and extract useful 
information for the decision makers, and “be ready to apply” the concepts and methods in practice in industry or 
in research, rather than learn calculations alone. This is a Business Foundation course with a minimum “C -“ grade 
is required  
(https://catalog.usf.edu/content.php?catoid=13&navoid=1486#college -level -requirements ).

depending on the need at individual campuses.  
• Categorical Data Analysis – Chi-square Tests  
• Analysis of Variance  
• Simple Linear Regression  
• Multiple Regression  
• Time Series Analysis and Forecasting  
 
VI. Course Objectives

statistical methods on business problems. In particular, students will be able to:  
1. Strengthen fundamentals, formulate hypothesis from the problem statement, and learn to perform 
analyses,  
2. Interpret statistical results generated from a selected software program and communicate the findings 
in simple terms to the decision -maker.  
3. Identify opportunitie s for and learn to apply statistical tests on Categorical data such as contingency 
analysis and goodness of fit tests  
4. Explain the basis and apply Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) techniques on data from 
experiments/observational studies in business  
5. Identify application opportunities and learn to perform simple linear and multiple regression analyses, 
extract valuable information, and apply the results for predictions and improved business decision -
making   
 
3 6. Analyze Time -series patterns and learn to appl y forecasting methods for various business applications  
 
VII. Student Learning Outcomes  
At the conclusion of the course students should be able to:  
1. Develop hypothesis from a problem statement, choose an appropriate statistical technique to apply given the 
probl em context, perform the analysis; and most importantly, interpret the reports/results, and develop well -
reasoned and evidence -based conclusions  
2. Learn to perform hypotheses tests on categorical data using Chi -Square goodness of fit tests and tests of 
indepe ndence  
3. Understand the principles of designed experimentation, identify an appropriate experimental design to 
perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on data from experimental/observational studies; develop hypothesis 
statements, perform the analysis, understa nd, and interpret ANOVA output from a select software; and 
develop conclusions  
4. Develop both simple and multiple regression models from given data, understand and interpret regression 
analysis output from a select software package, test hypotheses, and infe r relationships between variables, 
and make predictions on response.  
5. Develop an understanding for patterns in Time Series data, select appropriate forecasting techniques given 
the pattern, develop forecasts and forecast accuracy measures to identify the be st forecasting method

X. How to Succeed in this Course  
There is no way to do well in the course without learning. Just follow all the instructions and directions 
provided in the detailed schedule in this document and in weekly communications. Always be on time with 
learning and complete all the tasks on time. Follow the process steps as outlined here. Do not skip any step 
or short -circuit the process in anyway.  
i. Complete the reading assignments before class by Monday every week. Practice solving solved 
example problems in the course material word documents and in the textbook.   
 
4 ii. In class (f2f) section students – attend classes in person on all Tuesdays for the entire duration. Online 
section students – play and listen/view all the recordings (posted Tuesday nights) in full – do not skip 
any content. If you choose to do so, you also have the option to attend classes live on Microsoft Teams 
on Tuesdays.  
iii. Practi ce solving the solved example problems discussed in class on the PPT and in the demo video 
recordings on your own first. If you are able to solve those problems correctly on your own, that is an 
indication that learning has happened.  
iv. Start working on homew ork assignment problems on Wednesday in Excel. The sooner you get started, 
the more time you will have to work on them and to seek help if and as needed. Do not wait until the 
day of submission or even the final hours to get started on HW assignments. Subm it your homework 
report (as an Excel file) before the deadline typically 11:59 p.m. the following Monday (see the 
detailed schedule in this document for the deadlines). No late submissions are allowed for any reason. 
Students must meet deadlines for their own learning.  
v. Prepare well and submit Quiz before its deadline typically 11:59 p.m. the following Monday (see the 
detailed schedule in this document for the deadlines). No late submissions are allowed for any reason. 
Students must meet deadlines for their own learning.  
vi. Complete all the tasks assigned – HW assignments, Quizzes, and Exams. HW assignments is where you 
learn. Don’t miss work and lose points unnecessarily.  
vii. Review homework and quiz solutions after they are posted to bridge any gaps in learning. S eek help 
if and as needed.  
viii. Prepare well for exams. Solve all the problems on the exam. Do not provide random and irrelevant 
answers. Any additional inputs will be provided in the review session recordings. If you follow the 
above advise, you will do well.  
 
XI. Academic Continuity

XV. Additional Details on the Co urse Assignments and Grading Policies  
 
COURSE PARTICIPATION:  
Course participation on Canvas is mandatory on all weeks during the semester . It is mandatory that in-class 
section students must attend and actively participate (simply attending will not be enough) in class the entire 
class duration. There will be no allowances, and concessions on this requirement.  The nature of the course 
is such, and there is also strong evidence that students who participate in the course every week, stay in class 
the entire time; end up learning the subject matter better and earn good grades. Students must not only 
attend but engage themselves in the course proceedings throug h active participation, and  practice along in 
class all the problems that the professor demonstrates . Every in-class section student will be tracked for their 
attendance and class participation.  
 
Since Quizzes and Homework assignments are all announced at the beginning of the semester along with 
their deadlines on Canvas; they are due by the deadline indicated irrespective of whether you attended 
the class or missed the class due to various reasons . There will be NO allowances, concessions, or make -up  
 
6 work be given for missed HW Assignments and Quizzes that will be assigned zero points. Exams are due as 
indicated in the schedule. No make -up exams will be given for any one for any reason. Students do n’t need 
to do any extra work, all that they have to do is just complete the work assigned as indicated on time and 
every  time . 
 
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS:  
All homework assignments are individual tasks. Every week specific topic/s will be covered along with sol ved 
example problems. Homework will be assigned by 9 p.m. the day of class  (Tuesday)  that consists of a set of 
problems similar to the solved example problems discussed in class/on PPT files. You will have sufficient time 
as indicated on the detailed sched ule to solve the problems and to create a Report in Excel. Submit your report 
as an Excel file on Canvas before the due date and time indicated. Microsoft Excel MUST BE USED and for 
solving HW  problems. If Excel is not used (along with Excel functions and Excel Data Analysis Toolpak  options), 
zero points will be recorded for the HW assignment.  
 
The strict deadline for HW submission will be 11:59 p.m. US Eastern the following Monday as indicated on 
Canvas . For your convenience, they are also listed in the De tailed Course Schedule at the end of this 
document. There will be no extension of due dates. No late submissions will ever be allowed . Be prepared to 
lose HW points if the Report is not turned -in before the deadline . No e -mail  submissions or hard -copy 
submissions are accepted . All HW scores shall count towards final  grade . Homework Reports will be graded 
for Relevancy and Completeness but not for  Accuracy . As long as the submissions are on time, relevant, 
complete, and all the problems  are solved; you get full points . Irrelevant solutions will earn you zero 
points . You will get  partial credit for partial/incomplete solutions and submissions . HW report must 
demonstrate  student’s own work . If any HW reports are found to be copied, all the students who hel ped 
and/or received help shall be treated as violators, will receive zero points, and be reported for academic 
dishonesty. Solutions for HW assignments will be made available within a couple of days past the deadline. 
It is your responsibility to compare s olutions provided with your answers and learn from the same in 
preparation for exams. If you have any questions or need help, you MUST seek help from the instructor or 
student tutor as needed for your own benefit. Please remember that solving Homework Assi gnments on your 
own is the most  important step in preparing for exams . Colluding with classmates and other 
students/people, using external resources, tutors, hiring tutors t o finish the assignments , using tutoring 
websites such as Chegg.com … etc., and all other modes of cheating is strictly prohibited . Submitting work 
of tutors ’ and classmates ’ (as your own), and reports from tutoring websites such as Chegg.com … etc., and 
all other modes of cheating is strictly prohibited. Violators will receive zero points and be reported for 
academic dishonesty. Acade mic dishonesty will be dealt with very strictly under university policies.  If you 
do not us e Excel, Excel functions, form ulas, and do not generate Excel reports ; and do not submit Excel file  
as your HW report ; your HW report will not be grade d and zero points will be recorded as your grade. 
There wi ll be no exceptions to this requirement.  
 
READING ASSIGNMENTS AND QUIZZES:  
Reading Assignments are mandatory. Complete course material word document chapter readings and 
practice them in Excel before the deadlines indicate d prior to attending class. As you read the chapters, 
workout the solved example problems in Excel. If you are not doing  what is required to be done before 
attending classes, you are not doing what is essential for  succeeding in this course.  All Quizzes ar e 
individual tasks, typically multiple choice and/or fill -in the blank type. Quizzes are open book and open 
notes type and will test student understanding for the subject matter and not rote memorization nor the 
student ability to search out for answers be cause they will be of open book -open note type. You need to 
really learn the material and understand the subject to do well on quizzes. There will be Ten Quizzes in all as 
indicated in the detailed schedule. Every week specific topic/s will be covered in c lass. Once a chapter is 
completed, an on -line quiz will be assigned on Canvas using Honorlock . Each quiz consists of a set of 
“multiple choice or Fill in the Blank” questions. You will have sufficient time to complete the Quizzes held on  
 
7 Canvas - Honorlock . Quiz will be assigned usually by 9 p.m. on Tuesday.  The strict deadline for Quiz 
submission will be 11:59 p.m. US Eastern on Monday the following week as indicated on Canvas . It always 
helps and perhaps your performance will be better if the quiz is attempted after completing the homework. 
Each quiz will be timed and must be completed within allotted time  before the deadline indicated . All quiz 
scores shall count towards final  grade . A missed quiz will result in a score of zero. Solutions for the quizzes 
will be made available within a couple of days past the deadline. Academic dishonesty will be dealt with very 
strictly under university policies. Quizzes are administered onlin e in Canvas using Honorlock  based on USF 
system policies. Honorlock  violations will be reported for academic dishonesty. Colluding with classmates 
and other students/people, using external resources, tutors, tutoring websites such as Chegg.com … etc., 
and all other modes of cheating is strictly prohibited. Violators will receive zero points and be reported for 
academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty will be dealt with very strictly under university policies.  
 
EXAMS:  
Exams are individual tasks . There will be three exams and all of them are held  on Canvas - Honorlock  and 
must be completed within the time window indicated . Students cannot miss an Exam. No make -up exams 
are given . You must make sure you complete the exam and submit your file on time or be prepared to lose 
points. Exams will be open textbook  and open notes type . You are allowed to use laptops and perform 
calculations using Excel.  
Microsoft Excel MUST BE USED and for solving Exam problems. If Excel is not used (along with  Excel 
functions and Excel Data Analysis Toolpak options), zero points will be recorded for the  Exams. While there 
will be certainly number crunching involved, it will not be a major focus, and it will be  minimized  as much  as 
possible.  Exams  will test the student  understanding  for the application of the methods and interpretation of 
results. Problems on exams will be like the HW problems. You would not need statistical packages for the 
exams. Exams will be graded for Accuracy. All exam scores shall count towards fi nal grade . Exams are 
administered online in Canvas using Honorlock  based on USF system policies. Honorlock  violations will be 
reported for academic dishonesty. Colluding with classmates and other students/people, using external 
resources, tutors, tutoring websites such as Chegg.com … etc., and all other modes of cheating is strictly 
prohibited. Violators will receive zero points and be reported for academic dishonesty. Academic 
dishonesty will be dealt with very strictly under university  policies.  
 
XVI. Instructor Feedback Policy & Grade Dissemination  
 
Any feedback will be provided on Canvas. Grades will be posted on Canvas typically within a week or two past the 
deadline after resolving for any student issues.  
 
All submissions happen on Canvas. Instruct or will respond to email communication relevant to the subject matter 
within 48 hours of the date received. Students will know their Quiz score immediately after submission but not 
solutions key. For academic integrity reasons, Quiz solutions and HW soluti ons will be made available within 1 -2 
days after the deadline passes (after resolving any issues). Grades and comments (as appropriate) for Homework 
assignments and Exams will be posted on Canvas typically within 1 -2 weeks past the respective due dates. If  any 
delays happen beyond that time -frame due to unforeseen circumstances, students will be informed of the 
possibility of delays through e -mail. You can access your scores at any time using "Gradebook" in Canvas after they 
are posted.

14 XVIII.  USF Core  Syllabus  Policies  
USF has a set of central policies related to  student recording class sessions,  academic integrity and grievances, 
student accessibility services, academic disruption, religious observances, academic continuity, food insecurity, 
and sexual harassment  that apply to all courses  at USF . Be sure to review these online : usf.edu/provost/faculty -
success/resources -policies -forms/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx     
 
XIX. Course Policies: Grades   
 
Online Proctoring: Online exams and quizzes within this course will require online proctoring. Q uizzes and 
examinations will be administered using online proctoring tool - Honorlock . Keeping the audio and video 
(microphone and camera) on during such exams and quizzes is a must. Therefore, students will be required to 
have a webcam (USB or internal) w ith a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. Students understand that this 
remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private 
residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the res idence. To avoid any concerns in this 
regard, students should select private spaces for the testing. The University library and other academic sites at the 
University offer secure private settings for recordings, and students with concerns may discuss the location of an 
appropriate space for the recordings with their instructor or advisor. Students must ensure that any recordings do 
not invade any third -party privacy rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party 
privac y concerns. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. For additional 
information about online proctoring, you can visit the online proctoring student FAQ at:  
http://www.usf.edu/innovative -education/resources/student -services/online -proctoring.aspx  
    
Late Work Policy : No late work will be allowed in this course be it for HW assignments, Quizzes, or Exams.  
Student acquisition of knowledge in this course happens cumulatively. The nature of the course is such that 
student learning of topics must happen on a weekly basis as scheduled. Otherwise, it will affect learning the 
subseq uent weeks. All the due dates for the tasks in this course are announced on day 1. It is the responsibility of 
students to submit their work well ahead of time and to meet all the deadlines. If proper, correct, and valid 
submissions do not happen before th e respective deadlines; zero points will be recorded for the task. The only 
exception to this policy will be documented medical emergencies (if any) for the student needing medical 
attention with proper medical / hospitalization certificate. As all the dat es have been announced at the beginning 
of the semester, being on office trip, or on vacation, or on cruise, or forgetfulness, or being late by a second will 
not qualify for any exceptions or concessions as far as the assignment submissions go. Assignments  not submitted 
on time mean assignment was not turned in and will earn a zero credit.  
 
Extra Credit Policy : There will be No Extra Credit in this course.  There is no need to do any extra work in this 
course. Just do what you have been assigned on -time with out-missing the deadlines to become eligible for the 
grade. Every task (HW assignments, Quizzes, and Exams) assigned in this course shall count towards your grade. If 
you fail to meet the deadline, zero points will be assigned for that task. No exceptions.  Any exception will be made 
ONLY for medical emergencies / hospitalizations of the student with proper official documentation from the 
doctor/hospital.  
 
Grades of "Incomplete" : Students cannot demand an “I” grade as they wish. If any student is not earnin g good 
grades, that cannot become a basis for asking for an “I” Grade. In such cases “I” grade cannot be awarded. It can 
be requested only under exceptional circumstances for valid reasons and a decision will be made based on USF 
policy.  
The current unive rsity policy concerning incomplete grades will be followed in this course.  
For undergraduate courses:  An “I” grade may be awarded to a student only when a small portion of the 
student’s work is incomplete and only when the student is otherwise earning a pa ssing grade . The time limit 
for removing the “I” is to be set by the instructor of the course. For undergraduate students, this time limit 
may not exceed two academic semesters, whether or not the student is in residence, and/or graduation,  
 
15 whichever comes  first. For graduate students, this time limit may not exceed one academic semester. “I” 
grades not removed by the end of the time limit will be changed to “IF” or “IU,” whichever is appropriate.  
For graduate courses:  An Incomplete grade ( "I") is exception al and granted at the instructor’s discretion only 
when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond 
their control. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the "I" Grade Contract Form tha t 
describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a 
zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as 
long as it does not exceed two semesters  for undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate courses 
from the original date grades were due for that course. An "I" grade not cleared within the two semesters for 
undergraduate courses and one semester for graduate courses (including summer sem ester) will revert to the 
grade noted on the contract.  
 
Rewrite Policy : There will be no rewrites in this course. All quizzes and exams can be attempted only once. 
Students can submit their HW reports multiple times, but all the submissions must happen on ly before the set 
deadline (and not after).  
 
Make -up Exams Policy : There will be No Make -up Exams in this course. Exams can be attempted only once. Time 
windows for the Exams are announced on Day 1. It is the student responsibility to adjust their schedule s to give 
their exams during the exam time window. No change of dates will be entertained unless there is absolutely an 
exceptional circumstance at student’s end and for documented medical emergencies and only if student has 
notified the instructor in adva nce and certainly not after the deadline passes. As all the dates have been 
announced at the beginning of the semester, being on office trip, or on vacation, or on cruise, or forgetfulness, or 
being late will not qualify for any exceptions or concessions. If Exams are not submitted on time, zero points will 
be recorded.  
 
Exam Retention Policy : Not applicable for this course as all the Exams are Honorlock  -based. Student submission 
happen on Canvas so there will be an electronic record. So, whatever USF poli cy is for Canvas course retention 
that applies for the course.  
 
Essay Commentary Policy : Not applicable.  
 
Group Work Policy : All the tasks in the course – HW assignments, Quizzes, and Exams are individual tasks. There is 
no group work allowed in this cour se. If there is any group work in the group work, that would be plagiarism. In 
such instances, action will be taken on students based on USF policy on academic integrity violation.  
 
Final Examinations Policy : All final exams are to be scheduled in accorda nce with the University’s final 
examination policy.  
 
Campus Free Expression: It is fundamental to the University of South Florida’s mission to support an environment 
where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged and critically evaluated. Consistent 
with these principles, this course may involve discussio n of ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or 
even offensive.  
 
In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not as an 
endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the idea(s) presented can be tested 
by critical peer review and rigorous debate, a nd that the idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 
Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide that certain ideas 
are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked to engage with complex ideas and  
 
16 to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas. Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to 
believe it or agree with it.  
 
XX. Course Policies: Technology and Media  
 
Email : I am Dr. Ramakrishna Govindu, and I will be your instructor for this course. My e -mail address is: 
RGovindu@usf.edu . If you are e -mailing me, as a courtesy, please commence your email with a greeting such as 
“Dear Dr. Govindu,” “Hel lo Dr. Govindu,” or “Dr. Govindu.” Please write the appropriate subject and please write 
your name at the bottom of the email.  
 
How to communicate with me  
Given the ongoing pandemic situation, the best way to reach me is through e -mail that will be quicker. Leaving 
voice message on my office phone would not be good during these pandemic times. Response times can be longer 
that way. Sending an e -mail would be  the best given the current situation. Should you need help with the course, 
we can set up time to discuss remotely at mutual convenience. Meanwhile, you can email me with the questions, 
and I may be able to clarify your questions through an e -mail. If at all needed, we can set up an appointment at 
mutual convenience for a tele -conversation and if possible and required a Microsoft Teams meeting.  
 
How NOT to communicate with me  
• Please don’t post questions in the comments section of Canvas homework submissio ns. I will not read your 
comments until I sit down to grade your assignment.  
• Please don’t email me from a non -USF email account.  
• Please don’t submit deliverables to me through e -mail. It will be treated as a non -submission.  
• Please don’t reply to an email t hat I send to the entire class without changing the subject unless your question 
is about that subject. If you are using the “Reply” button as a means to get my email address in the “To” line, 
please change the subject line and delete all previous text fro m that email, if your email pertains to something 
else. In which case it is better to not use the “reply” button and just start a fresh email.  
 
How will I communicate with you?  
I will use the Canvas messaging utility to send you all emails pertaining to the course. So, you must check your USF 
mail account (and/or your e -mail where you receive USF e -mails by default). Whenever a student asks a question 
and I reply directly to that student. If and where the student question and my reply are ve ry important for the rest 
of the class to know, I will send out a mass e -mail, hiding the student identity. Students over the years found such 
inputs quite beneficial for them.  
 
When students send me e -mails, I get them in my USF e -mail Inbox, and I will r eply through my USF e -mail. If I am 
sending e -mails, I will use Canvas messaging feature to send e -mails. You should also do the same. I deal with 
almost hundred students and sometimes even more and I receive hundreds of e -mails. When you send e -mails 
thro ugh Canvas, I will instantly know who you are, in which course of mine you are in, I will understand the 
context for the question, and what is it that you are asking and why. That will help me to respond quickly. 
Otherwise, it could take a little longer. I  respond very quickly – sometimes within minutes, sometimes within a few 
hours, sometimes within a day or so depending on the nature and importance of communication, circumstances, 
and the situation at my end. I respond on weekends too. But expect the resp onse times to be little longer if it is 
weekends and if I am travelling. But be assured I will respond, and I will respond to student e -mails very quickly as 
I am able to.  
 
Do not send me e -mails on technological issues at your end. If the issues at your e nd are technology related you 
must reach out to USF IT Helpdesk, Canvas Helpdesk, and/or Honorlock  Helpdesk depending on the issue, and 
they will help you immediately. I won’t be able to resolve your technology issues.  
  
 
17 Canvas : Describe how you will use Ca nvas in the course, how often students should expect to login, how team 
activities will be organized, due dates, policies on late participation, etc.

USF's IT department at (813) 974 -1222 or help@usf.edu . 
 
Honorlock: In this course, we use Canvas - Honorlock  for all Quizzes and Exams. Students are therefore required to 
have a webcam with a microphone (either USB or mounted into your computer).   
All students must review th e syllabus and the requirements, including the online terms and video testing 
requirements, to determine if they wish to remain in the course. Enrollment in the course is an agreement to abide 
by and accept all terms. Any student may elect to drop or withd raw from this course before the end of the 
drop/add period.  
Online exams and quizzes within this course may require online proctoring. Therefore, students will be required 
to have a webcam (USB or internal) with a microphone when taking an exam or quiz. St udents understand that 
this remote recording device is purchased and controlled by the student and that recordings from any private 
residence must be done with the permission of any person residing in the residence.  
To avoid any concerns in this regard, st udents should select private spaces for the testing. The University library 
and other academic sites at the University offer secure private settings for recordings and students with concerns 
may discuss location of an appropriate space for the recordings w ith their instructor or advisor.  
Students must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third -party privacy rights and accept all 
responsibility and liability for violations of any third -party privacy concerns.  
Students are strictly responsible for ens uring that they take all exams using a reliable computer and high -speed 
internet connection. Setup information will be provided prior to taking the proctored exam. To use Honorlock 
students are required to download and install the Honorlock Google Chrome extension  (Links to an external 
site.) ." For additional information please visit the USF online proctoring student FAQ  (Links to an external site.)  
and Honorlock student resources  (Links to an external site.) .  
Students need to have access to a computer with the Chrome browser and can download the Honorlock 
extension. Your system also needs webcam, and you need to present your ID (any Photo ID would be enough 
you can simply u se your USF ID) for verification to get into Honorlock Quizzes and Exams.  
 
Specific information / instructions will be provided on all Honorlock Quizzes and Honorlock Exams. For 
additional information about online proctoring, you can visit the online proct oring student FAQ.  
 
WhatsApp, GroupMe, and Student -to-Student Communication : While students may use digital communication 
tools (WhatsApp, GroupMe, etc.) to communicate with fellow students, it is important to remember that 
academic integrity policies still apply in these environments. Informing others about the contents of tests  is 
prohibited by the official regulation , as is receiving unauthorized information about an examination. Students are 
expected and required to immediately report  instances of such violations to the instructor.  
 
Laptop Usage:  You would need a proper laptop with microphone and webcam (either built in or external) for use 
in this course. Describe your policies for using laptops throughout your course. Whether you dis like the use of 
laptops during your lecture, or whether you encourage using a laptop during discussion, or wish for all students 
using laptops to sit in a particular region of the classroom, feel free to state it here.  
  
 
18 Classroom Devices/Student Recording:  Not applicable. Describe your policies for using calculators, tape 
recorders, and other student -owned audio & technology devices for your course.  
 
Phone Usage: Describe your policies for student phone use in class, including text ing or surfing the Internet. If you 
are using social media for a “backchannel” conversation, mention it here. If you would prefer that students not 
take photos/video/audio recordings of you, or of the whiteboard notes at the end of the class, state so here .  
 
XXI. Course Policies: Student Expectations  
 
Attendance Policy:  In a 100% online, Course Participation serves as attendance Policy. Please refer to section XII 
for the details on Course Participation.  
Example: Students are expected to attend classes. Facult y must inform students of attendance requirements 
on syllabi. Instructors should accommodate excused absences by making arrangements with students ahead 
of time (when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work.  
 
Course Her o / Chegg Policy:  
The USF Policy on Academic Integrity  specifies that students may not use websites that enable cheating, such 
as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This does apply specifically to Chegg.com and 
CourseHero.com – any use of these websites (including uploading proprietary materials) constitutes a 
violation of the academic integrity policy.  
 
Professionalism Policy:  Complete your work and submit reports on time every time well before the respective 
deadlines on assignments.  
Per university policy and classroom etiquette, mobile phones, iPods, etc. must be silenced  during all 
classroom and lab le ctures. Those not heeding this rule will be asked to leave the classroom/lab immediately 
so as to not disrupt the learning environment. Please arrive on time for all class meetings. Students who 
habitually disturb the class by talking, arriving late, etc.,  and have been warned may suffer a reduction in their 
final class grade.  
 
End of Semester Student Evaluations:   
All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide feedback to the University regarding 
the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of the semester, and the University will notify you 
by email when the response window opens. Your participation is highly encouraged and valued.  
 
Food and Drink Policy:  Not Applicable.  
Example: Please adhere to the firm policy of  no beverages (other than bottled/capped water), food, tobacco 
products, or like items in the classroom. Your understanding of the necessity for this policy and cooperation 
will be greatly appreciated. This policy will be strictly enforced.  
 
Turnitin.com:  In this course Turnitin service will be utilized for all the assignments to prevent plagiarism. The 
University of South Florida has an account with an automated plagiarism detection service which allows 
student assignments to be checked for plagiarism. Turnitin is an automated system which instructors may use 
to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous 
database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected  to submit all 
assignments in both hard copy and electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor I receive 
a report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment. For a 
more detailed look at t his process visit http://www.turnitin.com .  
 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students are requested to 
maintain c onfidentiality as a way to keep their personal contact information (i.e., name, address, telephone)  
 
19 from being disclosed to vendors or other outside agencies. By your submission, you are also agreeing to 
release your original work for review for academic p urposes to Turnitin. 
 
In order to comply with privacy laws, students are not required to include personal identifying 
information, such as name, in the body of the document. While submitting to Turnitin, PLEASE 
REMOVE YOUR NAME FROM THE BODY OF YOUR PAPER  AND REPLACE IT WITH YOUR USF ID#. 
ALSO REMOVE YOUR NAME FROM THE FILE NAME AND REPLACE IT WITH YOUR USF ID# (e.g., 
“U12345678 Essay 1.docx”) before submitting.  
 
Plagiarism:  
Definition of plagiarism  in USF Regulation 3.027.   
Plagiarism is intentionally or carelessly presenting the work of another as one’s own. It 
includes submitting an assignment purporting to be the student’s original work which has 
wholly or in part been created by another person. It also includes the presentation of t he work, 
ideas, representations, or words of another person without customary and proper 
acknowledgement of sources. Students must consult with their instructors for clarification in 
any situation in which the need for documentation is an issue and will ha ve plagiarized in any 
situation in which their work is not properly documented.  
a) Every direct quotation must be identified by quotation marks or appropriate indentation and 
must be properly acknowledged by parenthetical citation in the text or in a foot note or 
endnote.  
b) When material from another source is paraphrased or summarized in whole or in part in 
one’s own words, that source must be acknowledged in a footnote or endnote, or by 
parenthetical citation in the text.  
c) Information gained in readin g or research that is not common professional knowledge must 
be acknowledged in a parenthetical citation in the text or in a footnote or endnote.  
d) This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, the use of papers, reports, projects, and other 
such mat erials prepared by someone else.  
 
Netiquette Guidelines  
1. Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers with respect, 
the same way you would do in a face -to-face environment. Respect other people’s ideas and 
be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not agre e with.  
2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. There will be 
people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and religious beliefs, or 
other general differences.  
3. Proofread and check spe lling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a thread on a 
discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and thoughtful. Avoid the 
use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, and it is more difficult  to 
read.  
4. Keep your communications focused and stay on topic. Complete your ideas before changing 
the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to easily get your idea or 
answers they are looking for.  
5. Be clear with your message . Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can’t see your 
expressions or hear your tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.

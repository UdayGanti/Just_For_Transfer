International students will typically have to maintain a full-time course load of 9 credits.  The only
exception is your last semester .  In your last semester , you can take less than 9 credits.  However , in
order to be able to do so, you will have to complete a Reduced Course Load form.  Contact
International Student Services for Details ( https://www .usf.edu/world/international-
services/index.aspx  (https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/index.aspx) ).
NOTE: All courses you take on an RCL  have to be either on-campus or hybrid.  You cannot take any
online courses.
If you decide to take a reduced course load, please only register for the course(s) you want to take. 
Do not register for any additional courses.  Doing so will lead to a delay in the approval of the RCL.
When you complete the RCL  form, you will need to list Dr . Reichgelt ( reichgelt@usf.edu
(mailto:reichgelt@usf.edu) ) as the approver .  Do not list muma-msbais@usf.edu  (mailto:muma-
msbais@usf.edu) as this will lead to a delay .
If, notwithstanding the previous paragraph, you enrolled for more than the course(s) you want to take,
you will have to send an email to muma-msbais@usf.edu  (mailto:muma-msbais@usf.edu) indicating
which courses you want to take in the last semester .  Dr Reichgelt will not be able to complete the
RCL form without that information. 
Also, do not send Dr Reichgelt any emails asking him to approve your RCL.  He will do so within 48
hours of getting a request from ISS to approve the RCL.
A full-time CPT  internship counts as a full course load. So, if you have a full-time internship, you do
not need an RCL.  
Also, once an RCL  has been approved, you cannot later register for an internship (CPT).
The deadline for submitting RCL  requests is the Friday of the first week of classes.

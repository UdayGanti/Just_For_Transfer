 
I.Welcome! First and foremost, I hope you are all keeping healthy and safe in these challenging 8mes. Beyond that, I want to welcome you to MAN 3240 and tell you how happy I am to share some 8me with you this semester.   Keeping up with course assignments will be a challenge, but, hopefully, well worth it as you gain informa8on to make you a beEer manager in the workplace. I know, for some of you, that this will be your ﬁrst online course.  Don’t feel alone: it’s a  rela8vely new teaching experience for me as well!    However, you won’t have to worry about driving to class in traﬃc, ﬁnding a parking place and—if you don’t feel like going to class at a speciﬁc 8me—having to be there.   BoEom line: I’m looking forward to taking advantage of this online learning op8on and ask you to join me in this exci8ng journey.  And, best of all, you can do it on your 8me, in your favorite space, snacking on your favorite food.  Bon Voyage!

MAN 3240:  Organiza:onal Behavior Analysis MAN 3240, 3 Credit Hours MUMA College of Business, School of Informa8on Systems and Management COURSE SYLLABUS II. University Course Descrip:on
The course covers research literature relevant to organiza8onal func8o ning including  
behavioral eﬀects of power and authority, formal organiza8on, structural varia8o n, leader
ship, mo8v a8on, and communica8o n.
III. Course Prerequisites
MAN 3025 with a minimum grade of C -.
IV. Course Purpose
The basic academic purpose of the course is to familiarize you with the “common body of  
knowledge” which is organiza8onal behavior in this third decade of the 21st Century.  One
semester on the topic will not make you an “organiza8onal behavior expert” but, at least,  
you should be familiar with the basic concepts, “terminology ,” theories and research 
ﬁndings that the course texts and online ac8v i8es emphasize.  As your instructor, I like t
o emphasize the prac8cal applica8ons of what you are learning.  As a psychologist and  bu
siness consultant I understand the importance of interpersonal eﬀe c8veness for pers
onal and business success; thus, a second purpose of the course will be to help you  m
ore eﬀec8vely manage your subordinates to increase their produc8vity and personals a8
sfac8on in the workplace.
V. Instructor Contact Informa:on and Communica:on
I am very informal.  You may call me by my ﬁrst name if you prefer; or, if you feel more  c
omfortable using 8tles, then feel free to call me “Professor Karlins.” I am ﬁne either way. I
 have already provided you with my oﬃce hours and my email address.  Please feel free to  
contact me! That’s what I’m here for.  Please understand I enjoy talking with student
s, and even though this is not a face-to-face class, it shouldn’t limit our opportunity t
o interact (only the way we do it).  Also, be sure t
o check your email and canvas regularly (at least 38mes a week) for any course updates.  I
 will be making regular
announcements that I hope you will ﬁn d helpful.
VI. First Week ARe ndance Policy
University policy requires that we ascertain if students signed up for the course are  act
ually taking it.  In a face-to-face class this is done by a roll call on the ﬁrst day of class.  
Online is a bit diﬀerent.  In this course you will establish your aEendance by par8c ipa8n g 
in an introductory discussion board, which can be found in the Gejng Started M
odule in  Canvas.  Students who don’t complete this ac8vity by the due date run the risk 
of being  dropped from the course. Be sure to complete the ﬁrst part of the discussion b
oard by Thursday night of Week 1 so you won’t be dropped from the course.
2VII.How to Succeed in this Course Generally, the majority of students in my class get a grade of “B” or beEer.  As in most things in life: the more work you put into this course, the beEer your grade will be. It is cri8cal that you keep up with your assigned readings and assignments. Please contact me immediately if you have any problems or concerns.  Falling behind in online courses is one of the biggest stumbling blocks students face, par8cularly if they haven’t taken such courses in the past.  Make sure you don’t fall into this trap! VIII.Course Structure  The course will be a learning experience designed around your textbook, reading assignments, my presenta8ons, case studies, various audiovisual clips and a group project.  Because the course is asynchronous, it will be up to each student to do coursework on their own schedule, remembering, of course, that everyone will s8ll be expected to meet various course deadlines as stated in the syllabus, various course assignments and/or canvas announcements. IX.Student Learning Outcomes  By the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:  •Deﬁne key terms in the ﬁeld of organiza8onal behavior •Recognize and recall key concepts and theories in the ﬁeld of organiza8onal behavior •Analyze real-world business problems and develop thoughmul, prac8cal solu8ons •Prac8ce skills that will make you a more successful manager. •Produce a quality group presenta8on on a topic pertaining to organiza8onal behavior.   X.Required Course Materials  You will be required to obtain the following textbook for the course: (1) Scandura, Terri.  Essen>als of Organiza>onal Behavior (3rd ed.)  Los Angeles: Sage, 2022.    Make sure it is the 3rd edi8on of the book.  This book will be available in the USF bookstore or on sale online.   Sage has an interac8ve eBook for $54 to rent as well.  Student resources (such as ﬂashcards and quizzes, et.) for the text are free and may be found at hEps://edge.sagepub.com/scandura2e/student-resources-0 (Links to an external site.).  Other study help will be provided at the end of each assigned chapter.   Unless otherwise indicated, all materials in Canvas are required. XI.Supplementary (Op:onal) Texts and Materials  3 Karlins, M. Life Management: 2.0 (2nd edi8on), Kendall Hunt: 2021.  Available at www.kendallhunt.com or  www.Amazon.com (The author receives NO royal:es from sales of this book!)  This book is op8onal, and you will not be tested on it in this course.  I now use this book in MAN 3025 and the strong posi8ve feedback from students about the impact of the book on their lives leads me to men8on it as a resource.  .   XII.Grading Scale  
XIII.Grade Categories and Weights Here are the various point totals for the classroom ac8vi8es you will be undertaking.  There are 1,000 possible points in the course (not coun8ng the extra credit project).  Each project you undertake will specify the speciﬁc points it is worth. 
There will be three mul8ple-choice examina8ons during the semester.  Each test will be 50 items in length, with each ques8on coun8ng as four points.  Thus, each exam will be worth 200 points.  All exams will be one hour in length and “open book” (you can refer to your notes and texts during the exam).  Once you start the test you cannot pause it; you will have one hour from the 8me you begin the test to complete it.  This is an individual exercise and students should not share informa8on about the test either while it is being taken or arer it is Grading Scale (%)90-100A80 - 89B70 - 79C60 - 69D0 - 59F

Ques8ons will cover chapters assigned in the text, plus cases/lectures/other ac8vi8es that take place online.  For the three tests, approximately 80% of the ques8ons will come from the Scandura text; the other 20% from online cases/lectures/ac8vi8es.

6XVI.Course Policies: Grades  Late Work Policy: Unless you have a valid reason (see “reasons for missing an exam” presented earlier in the syllabus), all graded work (and the extra credit project) not turned in on 8me will receive a grade of “0.” Thus, please be mindful of when your various tests and assignments are due. Grades of "Incomplete":  The current university policy concerning incomplete grades will be followed in this course.  An “I” grade may be awarded to a student only when a small por8on of the student’s work is incomplete and only when the student is otherwise earning a passing grade. The 8me limit for removing the “I” is to be set by the instructor of the course. For undergraduate students, this 8me limit may not exceed two academic semesters, whether or not the student is in residence, and/or gradua8on, whichever comes ﬁrst.  XVII.Course Policies: Student Expecta:ons Course Hero Policy: The USF Policy on Academic Integrity speciﬁes that students may not use websites that enable chea8ng, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This applies to websites such as CourseHero.com – any use of these website (including uploading materials) cons8tutes a viola8on of the academic integrity policy.  Sharing of any online materials provided by your instructor on Canvas: Much of the online material for the course is based on the published (or to-be-published) works of Professor Karlins, and are his intellectual property.  No part of the lectures (including the duplica8on of power point slides) may be given or sold to anyone (including websites that purchase such materials) or used outside of this course in any way without his wriEen permission.  Any student caught viola8ng this policy will receive a “double F” in the class.  Thank you for your coopera8on in this maEer. End of Semester Student Evalua:ons: All classes at USF make use of an online system for students to provide feedback to the University regarding the course. These surveys will be made available at the end of the semester, and the University will no8fy you by email when the response window opens. Your par8cipa8on is highly encouraged and valued.  Ne:queRe Guidelines:  1.Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers with respect, the same way you would do in a face-to-face environment. Respect other people’s ideas and be construc8ve when explaining your views about points you may not agree with.   72.Be sensi8ve. Be respecmul and sensi8ve when sharing your ideas and opinions. There will be people in your class with diﬀerent linguis8c backgrounds, poli8cal and religious beliefs or other general diﬀerences.   3.Proofread and check spelling. Doing this before sending an email or pos8ng a thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and thoughmul. Avoid the use of all capital leEers, it can be perceived as if you are shou8ng, and it is more diﬃcult to read.  4.Keep your communica8ons focused and stay on topic. Complete your ideas before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you allow the readers to easily get your idea or answers they are looking for.  5.Be clear with your message. Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can’t see your expressions or hear your tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.   Email and Discussion Board Guidelines: 1.Use the subject line eﬀec8vely by using a meaningful line of what your email or discussion is about.  2.Keep your emails and pos8ngs related to the course content. You should not post anything personal on a discussion board, unless is requested by the instructor.  3.Any personal, course or conﬁden8al issues should be directly communicated to the instructor via email. The discussion boards are public spaces; therefore, any issues should not be posted there.   XVIII.Course Technology & Student Support  Academic Accommoda:ons: Students in need of academic accommoda8ons for a disability may consult with Student Accessibility Services (formerly Students with Disabili8es Services) to arrange appropriate accommoda8ons.  Students are required to give reasonable no8ce prior to reques8ng an accommoda8on.in order to receive academic accommoda8ons.  Academic Support Services: The USF Oﬃce of Student Success coordinates and promotes university-wide eﬀorts to enhance undergraduate and graduate student success. For a comprehensive list of academic support services available to all USF students, please visit the Oﬃce of Student Success website at- hEp://www.usf.edu/student-success/  Canvas Technical Support:  Include informa8on where students can ﬁnd technical support.  Example: If you have technical diﬃcul>es in canvas, you can ﬁnd access to the canvas guides and video resources in the “Canvas Help” page on the homepage of your canvas course. You can also contact the help desk by calling 813-974-1222 in Tampa or emailing help@usf.edu. 8Changes to the syllabus: Although it is highly unlikely to happen, the course instructor reserves the right to change any part of this syllabus if he deems that circumstances warrant such change(s). XIX.Extra Credit Many of my students have requested the opportunity to do extra credit work to help give them the best grade possible.  I am more than happy to do this.  Please note:  You are NOT required to do extra credit, it is strictly your decision as to whether or not you want to do it. For those of you who wish to get up to 30 points of extra credit, please follow the instruc8ons below.  This will tell you how to sign up to  par8cipate in various research studies (you choose which ones you want) which will award you “SONA points” which go to your extra credit account.  For this course, ONE “Sona point” is worth THREE extra credit points for this class.  Thus, the most SONA points you will get credit for is ten (which equals 30 points in this class). If you decide to go for extra credit, don't wait un8l the end of the semester to do it.  Most of the studies wrap-up three weeks before the term ends. Instruc:ons for Voluntary Student Par:cipa:on The Customer Experience Lab Tampa Thank you for considering par8cipa8on in the Customer Experience Lab Tampa! The CE Lab Tampa is designed to enrich your understanding of research while also providing you a chance to earn extra credit for your course(s). You may have the opportunity to par8cipate in studies oﬀered either online or in-person. You will earn SONA points in exchange for each study completed: 1 SONA point for each 15-minute online study or 4 SONA points for each in-person study. Your professor will determine how much that credit is worth in your course. Please check your course guidelines or confer with your professor to conﬁrm how many studies you should complete to earn full extra credit. Below are instruc8ons outlining two (2) simple steps you need to take to par8cipate. Step 1: Create Your SONA Account (~2 minutes to complete) SONA is an online management system where you can view and par8cipate in online studies oﬀered by the CE Lab Tampa. However, you must ﬁrst create a SONA account for yourself. 9Note: Every student must create a SONA account even if you have par8cipated in a previous semester. Every student SONA account is deleted from the SONA system at the end of each semester. 1.Go to hEps://usf-cmsi.sona-systems.com 2.Click on the light green ‘USF NetID Log In’ buEon. 3.Select the CORRECT course(s) for which you want to earn extra credit. (e.g., ‘Morgan, MAR 4933, Social Media Marke8ng’) 4.If you are in mul>ple courses oﬀering this extra credit op8on, make sure to select each course to ensure they are linked to your account. 5.Click ‘Request Account’. Once you receive a conﬁrma8on email, you are good to go! Step 2: Check for Available Studies and Par:cipate 1.Go to hEps://usf-cmsi.sona-systems.com and log in using the light green ‘USF NetID Log In’ buEon. 2.Click on the ‘Available Studies’ buEon on your account homepage. You are eligible to complete any study you see on this page. The CE Lab Tampa Management team will send email no8ﬁca8ons when studies are available but you can also check this page on a regular basis. *You can only complete each study once and you can only apply the credit you earn for a single study to one course (i.e., you cannot apply the same credit to mul8ple courses). 3.Online studies: To par8cipate, click on the Study Title and then ‘View Study Website’. This will immediately re-direct you to a separate page (or tab) where you can complete the online session. In-person studies: Click on the Study Title and sign up for a study 8meslot. Arrive to the lab – BSN 2404 – 5 minutes before your scheduled 8meslot. Please do not bring food/drink. 4.Once you’ve completed a study, navigate to the ‘My Schedule/Credits’ tab from your SONA homepage to conﬁrm you received credit. **If you are in mul8ple courses, click “Reassign Credit” to choose the course you want the credit to go towards.** BEST WISHES FOR A GREAT SEMESTER!

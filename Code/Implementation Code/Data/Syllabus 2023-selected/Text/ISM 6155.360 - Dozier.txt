XIV. Course Po licies  
The following outlines the general policies for the major assessments in this course. Specific 
expectations will be posted in the instructions for each assignment on Canvas.  
 
Case Assignments:  
Cases are used as a primary teaching tool in this course becau se they provide insights into 
complex business topics using real -world scenarios faced by business leaders. The cases assigned 
in this course focus on decision -making related to enterprise technology systems. Students must 
come to class prepared to discuss  the assigned cases each week. To aid in the preparedness of the 
class, students must complete a pre- case assignment, which is due before  the assigned class. 
Students will take a  brief  quiz containing case details as the pre -case assignment. Students are 
expected to participate in class discussions, using their pre -case preparation as a guide . Students 
may be randomly called on in class to discuss various aspects of the case, which may count as 
participation. At the end of each case discussion class, studen ts are expected to submit a post-
case reflection to highlight their key learnings from the case. Each post -case reflection must 
include the in -class discussion topics and activities and must not summarize the case again. Your 
responses to all case assignme nts should be concise, direct, and structured. A rubric is provided on 
Canvas to outline how each assignment will be graded. Please contact the USF Writing Studio 
immediately for assistance with writing assignments, if writing is a skill you’d like to cont inue to 
improve in this course ( USF Writing Studio ). 
 
Course Project:  
A major course deliverable in this course is a final project that gives students an opportunity to 
demonstrate their learnings from the MSBAIS program. All project assignments must be submitted 
through  Canvas as a Word document, PDF document, or Video file (based on instructions) by the 
assigned due date and time. All written submissions will be analyzed using Turnitin, which is a 
plagiarism detection tool (see Turnitin section below) .  
 
Rewrite Policy : Rewrites are not available in this course.   
 
Make -up Assignments Policy : Makeup assignment opportunities will be given only for emergencies  
within one week of the original due date.  Students must discuss any reason for missing an 
assignment due date with  the instructor in advance of the due date unless the circumstances make 
such advance notice impossible. Written documentation must be provided to support any reason for 
missing assignment. There are only 6 reasons why a student will be given a makeup assignment 
opportunity:  
1. Medical purpose -  Students must produce a doctor’s note stating when and why he/she was 
unable to meet the due date.  
2. Death in the immediate family : Students must provide evidence that he/she was in 
attendance (or in transit to/from) a funeral on the assignment due date.  
3. Major religious holidays: Students must notify the instructor of the conflict within the first 2 
weeks of class.   
Page 6 of 10 
 4. Varsity athletic  events: a member of a USF athletic team may arrange for a makeup due 
date if a regularly scheduled League contest or post -season play falls on an assignment due 
date. A note from the coach will be required to validate the student’s absence.  
5. Jury duty: St udents must provide evidence, i.e., letter from the court, that he/she will be 
involved in jury duty.  
6. Military call up: the  appropriate commanding officer must submit a letter indicating the 
student is required to report for duty.  
The instructor will dec ide on the validity of the reason for missing a due date.  
 
Medical Excuses:  
Students should not attend class if they are ill, particularly if they have fever and/or gastrointestinal 
symptoms and/or respiratory symptoms such as a sneezing, runny nose, sore  throat  or 
coughing.  Students experiencing any of these symptoms  should  contact  immediately the  Student Health 
Services (813 -974-2331)  on the Sarasota- Mantatee  and Tampa campus or  the Wellness Center (727 -873-
4422) on the St. Petersburg campus  for appropriate medical guidance and to obtain a verification of care 
letter.   Students may turn to other health providers as well.  To be approved for missed classes, late 
assignments or missed examinations a verification of care letter must be presented by  the student to 
the faculty member upon return to class.  
 
Essay Commentary Policy :  
Commentary on written will be delivered in written format using the Feedback feature of Canvas and 
any applicable rubric.  
 
Final Examinations Policy : All final exams are to be scheduled per the University’s final examination 
policy.  
Grades of "Incomplete" : An Incomplete grade ( "I") is exceptional and granted at the instructor’s 
discretion only when students are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other  
circumstances beyond their control. The course instructor and student must complete and sign the "I" 
Grade Contract Form that describes the work to be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the 
student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomple te assignments. The due date can be negotiated 
and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed two semesters for undergraduate 
courses and one semester for graduate courses from the original date grades were due for that course. 
An "I" gra de not cleared within the two semesters for undergraduate courses and one semester for 
graduate courses (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contract. Students 
are expected to communicate with the instructor regarding “I” grade s before grades are submitted to 
the registrar’s office (students will be notified via Canvas email of submission date).

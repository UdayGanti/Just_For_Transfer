Course  Description  
 
Computers in Business (CGS 2100) is part of the University of South Florida's General Education 
Curriculum. It is certified for Information and Data Literacy. Students enrolled in this course will be 
asked to participate in the USF General Education assessment effort. This will involve submitting 
copies of writing assignments for review via Canvas.  
 
The two General Education assignments that are part of the USF General Education 
assessment are the #GEA1- Biz Café Report and #GEA2 -Biz Café  Excel Capstone.  
 In this course,  you develop  computer  proficiency  in the use of business  productivity  
software  using  Microsoft  Office  365 and running  a small business.  This course  
prepares  you to use Microsoft  Office  for coursework  assigned  in most  USF courses  
and you will attain valuable  entry  level  workforce  skills.  Excel  and Word  are at the 
top of the list of desired  skill sets for employment  in a myriad  of occupations.  You 
are introduce d to the basic  skills required  for entry  level  positions  and then  asked to 
use them  in making  business  decisions  for a small  business.  
 
There  is a mix of assignments  that ensure  you demonstrate  that you have  learned  the 
necessary  skills  using  Microsoft  Office,  interpret data  and identify  the changes  needed  to 
run a profitable  café . The course  is broken  into to two sections:  Microsoft  Office  essentials  
and the business  simulation.  
 
The Microsoft  Office  section  uses  MindTap/ Skills Assessment Manger ( SAM) to train  and 
assess  skills  in the Word,  Excel,  PowerPoint,  and Access applications.  
 
There is an emphasis  on Excel.  As you work  through your  Word assignments  you are  introduced 
to Biz Café,  a business  simulation  application,  where  you make  business  decisions,  submit  
reports,  and compare  sales and survey  data.  During  this process  you will demonstrate  a 
competency  with  Microsoft  Office  and how  to use the applications  to help  you create  reports  and 
analyze  information  related to  your  café. 
When managing your Café in the Biz  Ca fé business  simulation  program , you make  weekly  
decisions  in several  areas.  Your  decisions  at a specified  time  are evaluated  by an algorithm 
that compares  your  input with the other  student  run cafés  and calculates  your  results  for the 
week.  You receive reports  on your  sales,  inventory  and customer  satisfaction  to name  a few 
and information  on many  aspects  of the competing  cafés . You must  evaluate  what went  
right  or wrong,  analyze  your  coffee  shop  against  the competition  and create  an action  plan  
for the next  decision.  The Biz Café  competition  has your café competing directly with  the cafés 
in your industry (group of cafés).   
The start -up decision  is important,  and you will have  to make  weekly  special  decisions  which 
will include  expanding  your  menu,  adding  entertainment,  opening  on weekends  and make  
social  and ethical  choices.  You will integrate  your  income  statement,  customer  satisfaction  
and other  areas  to determine  how  you manage  your  decisions.  Reviewing  the Biz Café  
manual  and simulation  case is essential  to running  a successful  café in this simulation.  
 The approach this course  applies  to the applications  for Microsoft  Office  is that you learn  by 
doing;  the best  way to get familiar  with  Microsoft  Office  is to use it. You are introduced  to 
the Microsoft  Office  applications  through MindTap  modules . The training  assignments  are 
step -by-step  tasks  that take  you through  a project  but gives  you a fresh  start  for the next  
task should  you fail to complete  the task.  The assigned  module  project s cover  the same  
skills,  but you are graded  on the completed  project.  The simulation  skills  training  for each  
module  maps  to the module  learning  objectives  which  are tied to your  Student Learning  
Outcomes.  You will be assessed  on your  completion  percentage  for each  training  module  
and module  grader  projects  as assigned.  
 
Once  you are oriented  and comfortable  with MindTap  you complete  the training  for each  
assigned  module  which  prepare  you for the Biz Café  and MindTap  Projects.  In MindTap  you 
earn  points  when  you complete  training  and assigned  projects.  Feedback is immediate  and 
within  the training  you have  help  in the form of a short  intro  explaining  the task,  you can 
observe  the task completion  by viewing  a recording  or you can walk  through  the task with  
the aid of the simulation  in the practice  mode.  
 
After an orientation  and Biz Café quizzes  you make  business  decisions  for a café. You have  the 
opportunity  to run a café in a practice  mode  where  you operate  in separate  but identical  
environments  using  benchmark  competition.  This exercise  provides  you a great  opportunity  to 
gain experience  making  decisions  and using  the tools  and resources  available  in the simulation.  
You then  transition  into the competitive  phase  of the course . The four primary  areas  of 
responsibility  are management,  operations,  marketing , and special  decisions.  You determine 
pricing,  hours,  staffing,  how  much  coffee  to purchase  and more  as you compete  against  other  
cafés  in the course.

Estimate  of Effort  Needed  to Complete  Assignments 
 
MindTap  (SAM) training  and project s take  time  to complete.  This means  that you need  to 
devote  time  each  week  on the assignments  if you want  to stay on track  and not end up 
taking  short  cuts as due dates  approach.  Each  student’s  knowledge  and skill level  of the 
Microsoft  Office  applications  varies.  My estimations  are based  on my observations  over  
time.  
 
Biz Café  is a business  simulation  application  where  you run a coffee  shop.  Preparing  for each  
decision  will take  some  time  to keep  your  Café  competitive.  
 
There  is a wide  range  of skill sets in our class.  Those  that have  never  used  Microsoft  Office  
will need  more  time  to complete  tasks.  I allow  you unlimited  attempts  in the training  and 
you can submit  SAM  projects  three  times.  Even  though  you only  must  make  corrections  to 
your original SAM  project  for your  second  and third  submissions  there  still is a time  element  
needed  for each  submission.  
 
I estimate  that you need  to commit  a minimum  of 6-9 hours  a week  to this class  to stay on track.  
 
I suggest  you keep  track  of the effort you need  to complete  the first few assignments and 
make  the necessary  adjustments  to your  prep  time  and create  a work  schedule  that fits in 
with  your  other  obligations.

Class  Policies  and Procedures  
 
2022 COVID -19 Protocols : For the most recent communication regarding COVID -19 protocols, 
please visit:  https://www.usf.edu/coronavirus/  
 
USF Core Syllabus Policies: USF has a set of central policies related to student recording class 
sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, religious observances, academic continuity, food insecurity, and sexual harassment that apply to all courses at USF. Be sure to review these online at:
 
https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core -syllabus -policy -statements.aspx    
 Disruption to Academic Progress : Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the 
educational process. Disruption of the academic process (USF Regulation 3.025) is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the instructor: (a) directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the health, safety, or well -being of self or other persons.    
 Religious Observances : All students have a right to expect that the University will reasonably 
accommodate their religious obse rvances, practices,  and beliefs (USF Policy 10 -045). The 
University of South Florida, through its faculty, will make every attempt to schedule required classes and examinations in view of customarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or  communities comprising USF’s constituency. Students are expected to attend classes 
and take examinations as determined by the university. No student shall be compelled to attend class or sit for an examination at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. However, 
students should review the course requirements and meeting days and times to avoid foreseeable conflicts, as excessive absences in each  term may prevent a student from 
completing the academic requirements of a specific course. Stude nts are expected to notify their 
instructors at the beginning of each academic term if they intend to be absent for a class or announced examination, in accordance with this Policy.  
 
Academic Continuity: In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to 
suspend normal operations. During this time, USF may opt to continue delivery of 
instruction through methods that include, but are not limited to: Learning Management System, online conferencing, email messaging, and/or an alternate schedule. It is the responsibility of the student to monitor the Learning Management System for each class for course -specific communication, and the main USF, College, and Department websites, 
emails, and MoBull messages for important general information  (USF Policy 6 -010). For 
additional guidance on emergency protective actions and hazards that affect the 
University, please visit  www.usf.edu/em . 
 
Attendance:   
There are no scheduled class meetings in the online section.   You do have to complete the 
First Day Attendance Survey to meet USF’s first day attendance policy.  
 
Special A ccommodations : Students  in need  of academic  accommodations  for a disability  may  
consult  with  the Office of  Students  with  Disabilities  Services  to arrange  appropriate  
accommodations.  Students  are required  to give reasonable  notice  prior  to requesting  an 
accommodation.  I will work with  you to ensure  you have  access  to all course  materials  and have  
adequate  time  to complete  assignments.  
 
Student Academic  Grievance  Procedures:  The purpose  of these  procedures  is to provide  all 
undergraduate  and graduate  students  taking  courses  within  the University  of South Florida 
System  an opportunity  for objective  review  of facts  and events  pertinent  to the cause  of the 
academic  grievance.  An “academic  grievance”  is a claim that a specific academic  decision  or 
action  that affects  that student’s  academic  record  or status  has violated  published  policies  and 
procedures  or has been  applied  to the grievant  in a manner  different from that used  for other

Sexual  Misconduct/Sexual  Harassment  Reporting:  USF is committed  to providing  an 
environment  free from  sex discrimination,  including  sexual  harassment  and sexual  violence  
(USF System  Policy  0-004).  The USF Center  for Victim Advocacy  and Violence  Prevention  is a 
confidential  resource  where  you can talk about  incidents  of sexual  harassment  and gender - 
based  crimes  including  sexual  assault,  stalking,  and domestic/relationship  violence.  This 
confidential  resource  can help  you without having  to report  your  situation  to either  the Office  
of Student  Rights and Responsibilities  (OSSR) or the Office  of Diversity,  Inclusion,  and Equal  
Opportunity  (DIEO),  unless  you request  that they  make  a report.  Please  be aware  that in 
compliance  with Title  IX and under  the USF System  Policy,  educators  must  report  incidents  of 
sexual  harassment  and gender -based  crimes  including  sexual  assault,  stalking,  and domestic/relationship  violence.  If you disclose  any of these situations  in class,  in papers,  or to 
me personally,  I am required  to report  it to OSSR  or DIEO  for investigation.  Contact  the USF 
Center  for Victim Advocacy  and Violence  Prevention:  (813)  974- 5757.  
 
Campus Free Expression: It is fundamental to the University of South Florida ’s mission to support 
an environment where divergent ideas, theories, and philosophies can be openly exchanged 
and critically evaluated. Consistent with these principles, this course may involve discussio n of 
ideas that you find uncomfortable, disagreeable, or even offensive.  
 In the instructional setting, ideas are intended to be presented in an objective manner and not 
as an endorsement of what you should personally believe. Objective means that the ide a(s) 
presented can be tested by critical peer review and rigorous debate, and that the idea(s) is supported by credible research.  
 Not all ideas can be supported by objective methods or criteria. Regardless, you may decide 
that certain ideas are worthy of your personal belief. In this course, however, you may be asked 
to engage with complex ideas and to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas.   
 Understanding an idea does not mean that you are required to believe it or agree with it.  
 
Classroom  Conduct:  Students  should  behave  professionally  when communicating  with  other s, 
whether replying to a conversation or working with other students .   
 Communicating  with  Instructor  and TA’s : The TA ’s role is to support your assignments. My role is 
to support you in all aspects of the course . If you have any non- assignment related questions  or 
issue s you should contact me a nd not the TA ’s. 
 
-Student  to Instructor/TA  Communications:  We will review  messages after  7PM  during  the 
week  and periodically  over  the weekend.  If you have  not received  a response  within  24 hours  
you should  resend  your communication.    
 
-Instructor/TA  to Student Communications:  We will use the Canvas  announcement  tool the 
Canvas Home page  to pass on information and updates . We use Canvas  Conversation s to 
communicate  to individual  
students . 
 
-Personal  Messaging:  The TA supports  the course  assignments;  any personal  issue  or non-
assignment  related  request  should  be directed  to me. 
 
Incomplete  Grades:  A grade  of “I” (incomplete)  is in place  for unforeseeable  emergencies  
that occur  near  the end of the semester.  A grade  of “I” will be issued  only  in extreme  
circumstance s and then  only  with  complete  written  documentation.  
 
Due Dates  and Late  Work  
Due dates  for assignments  are found in Canvas  and MindTap.  It is important  that you complete  
all assignments.  Your  final  grade  is based  on the points  you earn  from  the assignments;  a zero  does not help  your  score at all.

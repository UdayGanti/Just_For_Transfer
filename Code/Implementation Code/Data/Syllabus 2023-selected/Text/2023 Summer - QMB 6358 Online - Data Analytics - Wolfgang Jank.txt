Description: The nature of business is changing. Due to increasing desktop computing power and
companies amassing massive amounts of data, business decisions are becoming more and more data
driven. Moreover , not only is more and more data becoming available, the nature of the data is also
changing. While in the past, most data arrived in the form of static flat tables, data is now becoming
increasingly dynamic, streaming and augmented with information that was not available previously
(geographical information, temporal information, network information). Moreover , data has become more
complex and is now available at dif ferent layers or hierarchies. For instance, while companies may have
individual-level information about their employees, this individual layer is often augmented by company-
level information across dif ferent industries. Data is also dif ferent in that it may combine static and
dynamic information. For instance, data from online auctions involve static attributes (such as the
product sold) as well as dynamic attributes (such as the incoming bids or the price changes during the
auction). Combining static and dynamic information is not trivial and calls for new methods suitable to
extract all information that such data carry .
First W eek Attendance Policy:  All USF classes must confirm the active participation/attendance of all
student in the class during the first week of classes. This is accomplished in this class through a short
question Quiz at the end of Module 0 (“Getting Started”) that confirms you have read this syllabus. Be
sure to complete the quiz by the deadline, or you may be administratively dropped from the course.
Objectives: In this class, you will learn dif ferent methods and models to address such data challenges.
Starting with methods for data-exploration and -visualization, you will learn how to build statistical models
around the patterns in your data. This course will focus on statistical aspects of data mining and as such
have a strong emphasis on data-driven models. That is, we will start with basic principles of linear
regression models, discuss when linear models are reasonable to employ and when their linearity
assumption breaks down. W e will then discuss dif ferent ways of relaxing the linearity assumption and
composing more powerful models. To that end, we will discuss simple “tricks” (such as interaction terms
and data-transformations) that will render the linear model more flexible. W e will also discuss data-
reduction techniques as well as variable selection methods that will allow the model to handle large
amounts of possibly correlated information. The course is very hands-on and will involve several data-
driven projects that are to be solved using state-of-the-art data mining software.
Learning Outcomes: Several learning outcomes are anticipated from this course:5/3/23, 1 1:44 AM Syllabus for QMB6358.020U23.50145 Data Analytics for Business
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1804074/assignments/syllabus 2/11To learn methods and concepts related to statistical modeling and statistical data mining
To understand when to use a particular method and to learn about its limitations
To implement methods and concepts on real data using state-of-the-art software 
This is a second-level course in data analytics and assumes that you have basic knowledge of statistics.
In fact, QMB6305 is a prerequisite for this course so I would highly encourage you to review basic
concepts of statistics if you feel that you might have forgotten some of them. While we will review some
of the concepts (i.e. we will review some of the concepts related to regression analysis throughout this
course), the main focus of this course is on the application  of these concepts to solving real-world data
problems. T o that end, the first few assignments (i.e. the first two quizzes related to reviewing basic
statistics and basic regression analysis) will be due rather quickly so please be sure that you make good
use of the first few days at the beginning of this course.

Data Mining Software:  We will use the software R for analyzing and mining our data. R is free! In fact,
R is an open-source based software and as such grows much faster than any commercial software
solution. R is one of the most powerful and popular software solutions for mining business data. In fact,5/3/23, 1 1:44 AM Syllabus for QMB6358.020U23.50145 Data Analytics for Business
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1804074/assignments/syllabus 3/11large analytical companies such as Google or AT&T use R. R is also becoming more and more popular
among government agencies (such as the DOD). R is powerful, yet it is free – this combination makes it
a winning proposition for many companies, especially during times of tightening budgets and financial
stress.
In fact, we will use the graphical user interface (GUI) R Commander for this course. PLEASE  CHECK

Course Assignments and Deliverables:
PLEASE NOTICE THA T ALL ASSIGNMENTS ARE INDIVIDUAL  ASSIGNMENTS; NO TEAM WORK
OR OUTSIDE HELP  IS ALLOWED
Homework Quizzes : Three homework quizzes are to be completed individually by each student. The
primary purpose of these assignments is for students to have the opportunity to practice the concepts
learned in class, and to implement them using real data and real software.
Online Discussion : Our online discussion will be facilitated via Canvas. The discussion will focus on
high-level aspects of analytics and data mining based on select chapters from the text “Competing on
Analytics” as well as the analytics and visualization projects.
For the "Competing on Analytics" discussion, students will be asked to share both their own
experience with analytics as well as their opinion based on research of companies in the Tampa Bay
area and beyond. That discussion has four dif ferent components, distributed over the four modules of
this course.
In addition, there are also several dif ferent discussion components related to the analytics and
visualization projects. 
In order to ensure that discussion contributions are students' original work, you will be able to see
other students' discussions only after posting your own discussion.  Please do not attempt to
circumvent this requirement as it may fall under USF's academic integrity policies.

Etiquette Guidelines:
General Communication Guidelines 1. Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your
instructors and peers with respect, the same way you would do on a face-to-face environment.
Respect other people’ s ideas and be constructive when explaining your views about points you
may not agree with. 2. Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and
opinions. There will be people in your class with dif ferent linguistic backgrounds, political and
religious beliefs or other general dif ferences. 3. Proofread and check spelling. Doing this before
sending an email or posting a thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your
message is clear and thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you
are shouting, and it is more dif ficult to read. 4. Keep your communications focused and stay on
topic. Complete your ideas before changing the subject. By keeping the message on focus you
allow the readers to easily get your idea or answers they are looking for . 5. Be clear with your5/3/23, 1 1:44 AM Syllabus for QMB6358.020U23.50145 Data Analytics for Business
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1804074/assignments/syllabus 4/11message. Avoid using humor or sarcasm. Since people can’t see your expressions or hear your
tone of voice, meaning can be misinterpreted.
Email and Discussion Board Guidelines: 1. Use the subject line ef fectively by using a meaningful
line of what your email or discussion is about. 2. Keep your emails and postings related to the
course content. You should not post anything personal on a discussion board, unless is requested
by the instructor . 3. Any personal, course or confidential issues should be directly communicated
to the instructor via email. The discussion boards are public spaces; therefore any issues should
not be posted there.
Analytics Project  - Kaggle Data Science Competition: The centerpiece of this course will be for you
to participate in a data science competition. The competition is hosted by Kaggle ( www .kaggle.com
(http://www.kaggle.com/) ) which is an online community of data scientists and which hosts private
and public data science competitions. The goal of this competition is to gain hands-on experience
with the execution and implementation of real data science projects.
Visualization Project  - Communicating with Data: In this module you will learn how to communicate
with data. First, you will learn how to use one of the most powerful data visualization solutions,
Tableau.  Then, you will use Tableau in order to create an insightful decision dashboard and publish
that decision dashboard to the web. And lastly , you will learn how to tell data stories with the help of
visualization software such as Tableau. To that end, you will identify a data source of your own
interest and then with the help of Tableau (and other resources) produce a short video in which you
will tell a story about your data. Have fun with this project and be creative! 
Grading:  Your final grade for the course is based on your performance outlined above. The weights
given to each of these components are as follows.
First Day Attendance                                      1%

GENERAL  ATTENDANCE POLICY
USF General Attendance Policy  (http://ugs.usf.edu/policy/GeneralAttendance.pdf)
Students are expected to attend classes. Faculty must inform students of attendance requirements on
syllabi. Instructors should accommodate excused absences by making arrangements with students
ahead of time (when possible) or by providing a reasonable amount of time to make up missed work.
DISABILITY  ACCESS
USF System Policy 0-108  (http://regulationspolicies.usf.edu/policies-and-procedures/pdfs/policy-0-
108.pdf)
Students with disabilities are responsible for registering with Students with Disabilities Services (SDS) in
order to receive academic accommodations.5/3/23, 1 1:44 AM Syllabus for QMB6358.020U23.50145 Data Analytics for Business
https://usﬂearn.instructure.com/courses/1804074/assignments/syllabus 8/11SDS encounters similar dif ficulties with course syllabi each semester . Highlighted here are some issues
to consider as faculty members develop syllabi:
Accommodated Quizzes, T ests and Exams
SDS administers more than 7,000 exams to the USF community each academic year . The student is
responsible for scheduling accommodated tests and exams with SDS. Students must schedule with SDS
at least one full week before the requested test date. Students who miss this deadline complete a Late
Exam Request Form requiring an instructor signature. SDS schedules late exam requests as space
allows and as close to the original test date as possible.
Due to the volume of tests and exams SDS manages, SDS cannot provide accommodated testing space
for "pop" or unscheduled quizzes. Consult with SDS for information on accommodating unscheduled
quizzes.
Make-up Exams
Students who are taking a make-up exam due to disability reasons (medical issues, scheduling conflicts
with other courses and extended exam time, disability related appointments etc.) should be allowed to
take a make-up exam within 10 business days of the student's return to classes. SDS schedules make-
up exams as space allows.
Online Proctoring such as Proctorio
Consult with SDS prior to a student who utilizes accommodations using Proctorio. Some SDS students
have atypical testing behaviors. Other SDS students utilize adaptive software that does not collaborate
well with Proctorio software.
Laptop or Electronic Device Usage
If prohibiting laptop, phone or electronic device usage in class, keep in mind that some SDS students
utilize such devices for note taking and recording. Still others have medical applications on cell phones
that the student cannot turn of f (blood sugar monitors, medication alerts etc.) Policies that indicate, "Only
those with accommodations may use such devices" inadvertently draw attention to the student with the
accommodation. SDS suggests using language that indicates, "Students utilizing laptops, cell phones or
other electronic devices for non-academic reasons during class time may be penalized . . . ."
Clicker Accessibility
Consult with SDS about alternatives to clicker points. Many SDS students have disabilities that af fect the
ability to answer clicker questions.
Attendance/Participation Accommodations Apply to all courses – Even on-line
If a student has attendance or participation accommodations, SDS provides an "Attendance/Participation
Accommodation Form" as part of the student's accommodation letter . This form is tool intended to guide
a conversation between a student and instructor about missed courses, missed deadlines and the
procedures to follow when requesting extensions. The accommodation does not allow a student to miss
an indefinite number of classes or deadlines. Instructors may always consult with SDS to determine what
is reasonable.5/3/23, 1 1:44 AM Syllabus for QMB6358.020U23.50145 Data Analytics for Business

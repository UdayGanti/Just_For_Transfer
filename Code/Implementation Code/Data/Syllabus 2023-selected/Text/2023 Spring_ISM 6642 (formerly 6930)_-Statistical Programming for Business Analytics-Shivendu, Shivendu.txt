COVID -19 Statement  
The health and safety of students, faculty, staff,  and visitors on our campuses is our top priority. In response 
to the current COVID -19 pandemic, the USF community will be working together to support compliance 
with recommended health and safety standards to optimize the learning experience while minimiz ing 
health risks. The Conduct Expectations for all members of the community may be accessed at (Conduct 
Expected to Support USF Health and Safety Standards) . 
Additional Covid -19 Procedures  
• All students must comply with university policies and posted signs regarding  COVID -19 
mitigation measures, including wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing during 
in-person classes.   Failure to do so may result in dismissal from class, referral to the Office of 
Student Conduct and Ethical Development, an d possible removal from campus.  
Course Description : 
 
With the proliferation of digital technologies in business , organizations, healthcare systems  as well as  in 
social interactions, the ability to understand, analyze , extract insights and interpret micro as well as 
macro business trends , data -driven insights in various domains including public health, social sciences 
and healthcare  has become increasingly more im portant today. Widespread  adoption of Big Data 
methods to analyze real time data is making data analytics invaluable for enterprises. This class aims to 
equip you with high -in-demand in the current job market data  analytics  as well as empirical analysis  
skills using SAS.  
 
The course focus es on extracting business insights  as well as relevant relationships between variables of 
interest by leveraging firm's business data , online social media content , as well as data from other  2 
 relevant sources  for various applications, including (but not limited to) social media analytics, market 
analysis and demand estimation, customer segmentation, customer relationship management (CRM), and 
health care management.  The class will be hands -on, and the emphasis will be placed on the "know -how" 
aspect - how to extract and apply data -driven  insights  to improve business as well as organizational 
decision making and strategies.  
 
We w ill analyze real -world data from many enterprises as well as othe r domains like healthcare and 
public health using statistical software SAS.   This implies that you will learn programming on a widely 
used statistical analysis  software, SAS, along with in -depth applications of advanced statistical methods. 
The course w ill also intro duce some advanced predictive models  with applications in business as well as 
in healthcare and public health context. Prior programming skill is not required .  
 
Each session of the course will be organized in two modules: Statistical Methods an d Tools Module and 
SAS Programming Module. Some of the course content will be available online on Canvas before the 
session.  
  
Course Objectives:  
 
• Differentiate, design and assess various data analytics and data mining models  
• Identify and translate real -world business problems into data analytics and data mining 
problems  
• Exhibit ability in pre -preparing and visualizing the right data towards these problems  
• Develop proficiency in statistical methods  
• Implement data ana lytics models  to solve t hese problems  
• Develop proficiency in statistical programming for various business applications  
• Enhance knowledge and skills in the current trends in the management and use of BI.  
 
Course Format/Location: In-class Lecture: Tuesday, 8 .30 am - 12.15  pm,  
 
Cou rse Materi als: 
• No Textbook for the statistical analysis.  
• For SAS Programming, we will use a textbook : A Gentle Introduction to Statistics Using SAS 
Studio ; and a reference book  
• A Handbook of Statistical Analyses using SAS by Der and Ev eritt  
 
The following books are highly recommended,  and the course will cover some of the chapters from some 
of these books. In addition, relevant articles, reading material will be posted on Canvas.  
 
In this class , we will learn and use SAS Enterprise Guide + and you can access that through your browser 
from https://usfapps.cloud.com/Citrix/StoreWeb/#/apps/all  . Enterprise Guide is  a point -and-click, menu - 
and wizard -driven tool that empowers users to analyze data and publish their results while in background 
all analysis is done in SAS Base program.  
 
We will borrow many examples, pedagogue, content and material from an excellent book, “A Littl e SAS 
Book for Enterprise Guide by Slaughter and Delwiche, 2017 edition”. Having access to this book will help 3 
 in getting setup and running very quickly. There are good number of free resources available on the 
Internet to get you started on SAS Enterprise  Guide. Another good book is,”  Data Analysis Using SAS 
Enterprise Guide by Meyers, Gamst and Guarino.  There are many g ood tutorials available at 
https://support.sas.com/en/software/enterprise -guide -support.html  and other credible sources.  
 
Though the  core objective  of the class will be using statistical and econometric methods to get meaningful 
insights from data, we will use SAS as a tool to achieve that objective.  
 
Furthermore, we will also be using material and examples from another excellent source from UCLA: 
https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/sas/  . We will be extensively using material relating to SAS and examples from 
https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/sas/modules/  as w ell as from  https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult -
pkg/seminars/#SAS  . Please take your time to get familiar with the material.  
 
The bulk of SAS documentation is available online , at 
http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/index.html. A catalog of printed documentation 
available from SAS can be found at http://support.sas.com/publishing/index.html.

 Project Presentations   
 
A. Project:   
 
This is a group project,  and each project will be executed by a two -member team. In special 
circumstances, a team may have up to three members. In this project, you will use the statistical methods 
and concepts learned in class to a real -world decision -making  situation. You will identify a data -driven 
decision scenario of business relevance, source appropriate data, clean the data if required, analyze the 7 
 data  using SAS , and derive actionable insights from your analyses  by appropriately interpreting results . 
To the extent possible  you will also do some robustness checks. All data analysis must be executed using 
SAS.  
 
Your final deliverables include a project report ( 8-10 pages) and an end -of-semester team presentation. 
Your project must include the following sections: (1) executive  summary; (2) table of contents; (3) 
problem significance; (4) data source/preparation; (5) hypotheses; (6) descriptive analysis; (7) models 
including results and interpretation of results; (8) robustness checks; and (9) actionable insights based on 
the re sults; (10) limitations of your analysis. Project should not be driven by making predictions t hat is 
not the focus of this class.   
  
Feel free to consult with me about your data set or projects. I do give extra -credit to teams who surpass 
my expectations,  experiment with new methods and tools, and help the class learn something new.

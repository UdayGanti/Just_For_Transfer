               exceeding $2 billion.During the early stage of his career, Vinik managed the Fidelity Magellan Fund, averaging
               17 percent annual returns. After leaving Fidelity, he founded the Vinik Asset Management
               hedge fund. In 2000, Vinik decided to focus on managing his own portfolio and, ten
               years later, he purchased the Tampa Bay Lightning. He envisioned an NHL experience
               like none other, one that focused on fans as much as the team – and recognized the
               importance of building the Tampa Bay community.
